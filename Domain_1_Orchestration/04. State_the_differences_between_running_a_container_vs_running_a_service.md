# Differences Between Running a Container vs. Running a Service

| Feature               | Running a Container                      | Running a Service (in Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) |
|----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Scope**            | Runs a single container instance. | Manages multiple instances (replicas) of containers. |
| **Scaling**          | Manual; requires running multiple instances manually. | Supports automatic scaling and load balancing. |
| **Networking**       | Uses Dockerâ€™s default bridge network unless configured otherwise. | Uses an overlay network for communication between service replicas. |
| **Persistence**      | Persistent storage must be explicitly configured. | Typically integrated with persistent storage solutions. |
| **Fault Tolerance**  | No built-in recovery; container stops if it crashes. | Automatically restarts failed instances. |
| **Orchestration**    | No orchestration; runs independently. | Managed by an orchestrator like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes. |
| **Deployment**       | `docker run` is used to start a single container. | `docker service create` (Swarm) or `kubectl apply` (Kubernetes) is used to deploy services. |
| **Load Balancing**   | No built-in load balancing; requires additional configuration. | Built-in load balancing across replicas. |
