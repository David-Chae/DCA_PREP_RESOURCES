## If docker-compose2.yml is present in the working directory, how can I use it to run docker compose up command?

Great question! If your Compose file is named something other than the default `docker-compose.yml` (like `docker-compose2.yml`), you can use the `-f` flag to specify it explicitly.

## âœ… Command to Use a Custom Compose File

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose2.yml up
```

### ðŸ”„ Optional Flags

- To run in **detached** mode (in the background):

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose2.yml up -d
```

- To also rebuild images if needed:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose2.yml up --build
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ Note
- `docker compose` (with a space) is the **newer CLI plugin**, preferred over `docker-compose` (hyphenated).
- You can specify **multiple files** by repeating the `-f` flag:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up
```

Let me know if you want to merge multiple Compose files or override specific services!
