To **remove a Docker Compose project**, including containers, networks, and volumes created by `docker compose up`, you can use:

---

## 🧹 Basic Cleanup

### 🔻 Stop and Remove Everything
```bash
docker compose down
```

This command:
- Stops all containers in the Compose project
- Removes the containers
- Removes default networks created for the project

---

## 🚿 Full Cleanup Options

### 💣 Remove Everything *including named volumes*:
```bash
docker compose down --volumes
```

### 🔥 Also remove **images** built by Compose:
```bash
docker compose down --rmi all
```

### 💀 Fully clean up everything (containers, networks, volumes, images):
```bash
docker compose down --rmi all --volumes
```

---

## 📁 Tip: Project Name Awareness

Docker Compose uses the **directory name** as the default project name. If you're using a custom file or different project name:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose2.yml -p myproject down --volumes --rmi all
```

> `-p myproject` ensures you’re targeting the correct project name if it's not the default.

Let me know if you also want to clean up **dangling volumes or images** globally!
