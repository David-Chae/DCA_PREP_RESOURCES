Great! Self-testing is a solid way to reinforce your understanding. For the Docker Certified Associate (DCA) exam topic **“Describe and demonstrate orchestration activities”**, you'll need to know how to **use Docker Swarm** (since Kubernetes is not the focus of the DCA exam as of the latest versions), including:

- Initializing a swarm
- Deploying services
- Scaling services
- Inspecting and updating services
- Performing rolling updates
- Managing nodes and tasks

Let’s simulate a self-test session with a mix of multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions. Let me know if you'd prefer command-line challenges or flashcards instead.

**7. Multiple Choice**  
What is the purpose of a manager node in Docker Swarm?
