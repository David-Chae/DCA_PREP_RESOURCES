## Describe how to deploy containerized workloads as Kubernetes pods and deployments

This is a **core concept** for both Docker and Kubernetes certification exams. Let’s break it down into a **clear, step-by-step process** to deploy containerized workloads using **Kubernetes Pods and Deployments**.

---

## 🚀 What You’ll Learn
- ✅ What Pods and Deployments are
- ✅ How to define them using YAML
- ✅ How to apply them to a cluster

---

## 📦 Step 1: Understand Pods and Deployments

### ✅ Pods
- The **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.
- Typically run **one container**, but can run multiple tightly-coupled containers.

### ✅ Deployments
- A higher-level controller that manages Pods.
- Allows **rolling updates**, **scaling**, and **self-healing**.

---

## 📄 Step 2: Example YAML for a Deployment

```yaml
# my-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: myapp-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: myapp-container
          image: nginx:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```

🧠 **What's happening:**
- Deploys **3 replicas** of an NGINX container.
- Kubernetes ensures these Pods are always running.

---

## 🖥️ Step 3: Apply the Deployment to the Cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml
```

✅ This creates:
- A **Deployment** named `myapp-deployment`
- 3 **Pods** running NGINX

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Verify Everything is Running

```bash
kubectl get deployments
kubectl get pods
```

To inspect a specific pod:
```bash
kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
```

---

## 🌐 Step 5 (Optional): Expose the Deployment

Create a service to expose it:

```bash
kubectl expose deployment myapp-deployment --type=NodePort --port=80
```

Or use a `Service` YAML for more control.

---

## 🧽 Cleanup

```bash
kubectl delete -f my-deployment.yaml
```

---

## ✅ Summary

| Object       | Purpose                             |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Pod**      | Runs containers                     |
| **Deployment** | Manages Pods, enables scaling, updates |
| **Service**  | Exposes Pods over the network       |

Awesome! You're doing great. Here's how you can **self-test** on the topic of **deploying containerized workloads as Kubernetes Pods and Deployments**, using both **theory checks** and **hands-on exercises**:

## 🧠 **Theoretical Self-Test Questions**

Try answering these without looking at your notes:

### ❓ 1. What is the difference between a Pod and a Deployment?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
A **Pod** runs one or more containers and is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. A **Deployment** is a controller that manages Pods and allows features like scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing.
</details>

---

### ❓ 2. What command is used to apply a Deployment to a cluster?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`kubectl apply -f my-deployment.yaml`
</details>

---

### ❓ 3. How do you expose a Deployment on a specific port?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`kubectl expose deployment myapp-deployment --type=NodePort --port=80`
</details>

---

### ❓ 4. What section of the YAML defines the number of Pods to run?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
The `replicas` field under `spec` in the Deployment YAML.
</details>

---

### ❓ 5. What command lists all running Pods?
<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`kubectl get pods`
</details>

---

## 🧪 **Hands-On Practice**

You can spin up a local Kubernetes cluster using [**Minikube**](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or [**kind**](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and go through these:

### ✅ Practical Tasks:
1. Write a `Deployment` YAML from scratch (try not to copy-paste).
2. Apply the deployment and verify pods are running.
3. Scale it to 5 replicas:  
   ```bash
   kubectl scale deployment myapp-deployment --replicas=5
   ```
4. Update the image to a newer version (e.g., `nginx:1.25`) and apply it.
5. Expose the deployment using a service and access it in your browser or via curl.
6. Clean up all resources:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete deployment myapp-deployment
   kubectl delete service myapp-deployment
   ```

## 📝 Bonus Challenge

Write a YAML for a Deployment that:
- Runs an `httpd` (Apache) container
- Has 2 replicas
- Exposes port 80
- Is labeled as `tier: frontend`

(Then apply it and test!)
