Great! Self-testing is a solid way to reinforce your understanding. For the Docker Certified Associate (DCA) exam topic **‚ÄúDescribe and demonstrate orchestration activities‚Äù**, you'll need to know how to **use Docker Swarm** (since Kubernetes is not the focus of the DCA exam as of the latest versions), including:

- Initializing a swarm
- Deploying services
- Scaling services
- Inspecting and updating services
- Performing rolling updates
- Managing nodes and tasks

Let‚Äôs simulate a self-test session with a mix of multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions. Let me know if you'd prefer command-line challenges or flashcards instead.

</details>

---

A. `docker swarm create`  
B. `docker swarm init`  
C. `docker swarm start`  
D. `docker init swarm`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
‚úÖ **B.** `docker swarm init`

**3. Short Answer**  
What command would you use to scale a service named `web` to 5 replicas in Docker Swarm?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`docker service scale web=5`
</details>

---

**4. Multiple Choice**  
Which command allows you to inspect the tasks of a running service?

A. `docker service inspect`  
B. `docker service ps`  
C. `docker ps`  
D. `docker service logs`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
‚úÖ **B.** `docker service ps`

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`docker service update --image yourimage:2 api`
</details>

---

**7. Multiple Choice**  
What is the purpose of a manager node in Docker Swarm?

A. To monitor logs  
B. To execute user containers  
C. To make orchestration decisions and manage cluster state  
D. To serve as a DNS resolver

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
‚úÖ **C.** Manager nodes control orchestration and cluster management.
</details>

---

**8. Short Answer**  
How would you deploy a Docker stack named `myapp` using a Compose file?

<details>
<summary>Answer</summary>
`docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml myapp`
</details>

---

Would you like some hands-on practice scenarios or explanations for any of these topics?

Absolutely! Let's first **describe** what a **rolling update** is in Docker Swarm, then walk through a **hands-on step-by-step demo** using commands.

---

## üåÄ What Is a Rolling Update?

In **Docker Swarm**, a **rolling update** is the process of **updating service tasks incrementally**, rather than all at once. It helps ensure **zero or minimal downtime** when deploying new versions of your application.

When you update a service (like changing the image tag), Docker Swarm will:

- Stop and replace **a few tasks at a time** (based on `--update-parallelism`)
- Wait for a specified **delay** (`--update-delay`) before updating the next batch
- Optionally **rollback** if the update fails

---

## üöÄ Demonstration: Rolling Update in Docker Swarm

Let‚Äôs go through it **step-by-step**.

---

### üîß Step 1: Initialize Swarm (if not already done)

```bash
docker swarm init
```

> This sets your current Docker node as a **Swarm manager**.

---

### üê≥ Step 2: Create a Demo Service

```bash
docker service create \
  --name webapp \
  --replicas 3 \
  --publish 8080:80 \
  nginx:1.21
```

> This creates a service with 3 replicas using **Nginx v1.21**.

---

### üîç Step 3: View Service and Tasks

```bash
docker service ls
docker service ps webapp
```

> Confirms that your service and tasks are running.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Perform a Rolling Update

```bash
docker service update \
  --image nginx:1.23 \
  --update-parallelism 1 \
  --update-delay 10s \
  webapp
```

> This command tells Docker to:
> - Use **nginx:1.23**
> - Update **1 container at a time**
> - Wait **10 seconds** before moving to the next

---

### üîé Step 5: Observe the Update

Use the following to watch the tasks transition:

```bash
watch docker service ps webapp
```

> You'll see tasks stop and start one at a time.

---

### üîÅ Step 6 (Optional): Rollback If Something Goes Wrong

```bash
docker service update --rollback webapp
```

> This reverts the service back to the **previous working image/config**.

---

### üì¶ Bonus: Customize Update Behavior at Creation

You can also **set update config during service creation**:

```bash
docker service create \
  --name webapp \
  --replicas 3 \
  --update-delay 5s \
  --update-parallelism 1 \
  nginx:1.21
```

Then later:

```bash
docker service update --image nginx:1.23 webapp
```
