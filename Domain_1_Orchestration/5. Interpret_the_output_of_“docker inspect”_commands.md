Great! Here's a practical plan to **self-test** on the DCA exam point:

---

## 🧪 Objective:  
**Interpret the output of `docker inspect` commands**

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Self-Testing Guide:

---

### ✅ 1. **Run `docker inspect` on real objects**

Start by creating real Docker objects so you can inspect them:

```bash
docker run -d --name test-nginx nginx
```

Then try:

```bash
docker inspect test-nginx
```

You’ll see a **huge JSON output**. Try interpreting the following key fields:

| Key | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `Id` | Unique container ID |
| `Name` | Container name |
| `State.Status` | Current status (running, exited, etc.) |
| `NetworkSettings.IPAddress` | Container’s IP address (bridge network) |
| `Mounts` | Volumes attached to the container |
| `Config.Image` | The image used |
| `HostConfig.RestartPolicy.Name` | Restart policy applied |
| `Created` | Timestamp when container was created |

---

### 🧠 2. **Ask yourself interpretation questions**

After running `docker inspect`, try answering:

- What is the IP address of this container?
- Is there a volume mounted?
- What is the restart policy?
- What is the image this container is using?
- Is this container running or stopped?

---

### 🛠️ 3. **Use `--format` for focused output**

Try formatting specific fields:

```bash
docker inspect --format '{{ .State.Status }}' test-nginx
docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' test-nginx
docker inspect --format '{{ .Mounts }}' test-nginx
```

This helps you learn the structure of the object.

---

### 🧪 4. **Inspect other object types**

Test with other Docker object types:

```bash
docker volume inspect <volume-name>
docker network inspect <network-name>
docker image inspect <image-id-or-name>
```

Try answering:
- Which containers are connected to this network?
- What driver is used?
- What’s the image’s creation time?
- What layers are in this image?

---

### 📝 5. **Create flashcards or cheat sheet**

Practice key fields like:
- `.State.Running`
- `.HostConfig.PortBindings`
- `.NetworkSettings.Networks`
- `.Mounts[].Source`
- `.Mounts[].Destination`

I can help you generate flashcards if you want!
