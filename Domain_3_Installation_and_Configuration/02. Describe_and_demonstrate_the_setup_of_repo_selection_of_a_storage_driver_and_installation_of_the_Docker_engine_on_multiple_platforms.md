# Setup of Repository, Selection of Storage Driver, and Installation of Docker Engine on Multiple Platforms

## Overview

This guide provides instructions on setting up a repository, selecting a storage driver, and installing Docker Engine on multiple platforms. It covers the necessary steps for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Setting Up a Repository

### Linux

1. **Add Docker's Official GPG Key**:
    ```bash
    # Add Docker's official GPG key:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
    sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
    sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
    ```

2. **Add Docker Repository**:
    ```bash
    # Add the repository to Apt sources:
    echo \
      "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
      $(. /etc/os-release && echo "${UBUNTU_CODENAME:-$VERSION_CODENAME}") stable" | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
    ```

3. **Update Package Repository**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

### Windows

1. **Download Docker Desktop**:
    - Visit the Docker website and download Docker Desktop for Windows.

2. **Install Docker Desktop**:
    - Follow the installation wizard to install Docker Desktop.

### macOS

1. **Download Docker Desktop**:
    - Visit the Docker website and download Docker Desktop for macOS.

2. **Install Docker Desktop**:
    - Follow the installation wizard to install Docker Desktop.

## Selection of a Storage Driver

### Overview

Docker supports several storage drivers. The choice of storage driver affects performance, stability, and compatibility. The most commonly used storage drivers are:

- **overlay2**: Default and recommended for most Linux distributions.
- **aufs**: Older driver, still available for backward compatibility.
- **btrfs**: Supports advanced features like snapshots and compression.
- **devicemapper**: Used for older systems or specific use cases.
- **vfs**: Intended for testing purposes.

# Docker Storage Drivers Overview

| Driver           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `overlay2`       | `overlay2` is the preferred storage driver for all currently supported Linux distributions, and requires no extra configuration.                                         |
| `fuse-overlayfs` | `fuse-overlayfs` is preferred only for running Rootless Docker on an old host that does not provide support for rootless `overlay2`. The `fuse-overlayfs` driver does not need to be used since Linux kernel 5.11, and `overlay2` works even in rootless mode. Refer to the [rootless mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) documentation for details. |
| `btrfs` and `zfs`| The `btrfs` and `zfs` storage drivers allow for advanced options, such as creating "snapshots", but require more maintenance and setup. Each of these relies on the backing filesystem being configured correctly.|
| `vfs`            | The `vfs` storage driver is intended for testing purposes, and for situations where no copy-on-write filesystem can be used. Performance of this storage driver is poor, and is not generally recommended for production use.                                                  |


### Choosing a Storage Driver

1. Stop Docker.  
```bash
sudo systemctl stop docker
```

2. Copy the contents of /var/lib/docker to a temporary location.  
```bash
cp -au /var/lib/docker /var/lib/docker.bk
````

3. If you want to use a separate backing filesystem from the one used by /var/lib/, format the filesystem and mount it into /var/lib/docker. Make sure to add this mount to /etc/fstab to make it permanent.  


4. Edit /etc/docker/daemon.json. If it doesn't yet exist, create it. Assuming that the file was empty, add the following contents.
```json
{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
```

5. Start Docker.

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

6. Verify that the daemon is using the overlay2 storage driver. Use the docker info command and look for Storage Driver and Backing filesystem. 
```bash
docker info

Containers: 0
Images: 0
Storage Driver: overlay2
 Backing Filesystem: xfs
 Supports d_type: true
 Native Overlay Diff: true
<...>
```

## Letâ€™s work through each of these questions one by one. These are the kinds of conceptual insights the Docker Certified Associate exam might test â€” not just "how," but also "why."

---

### âœ… **What are best practices for driver selection?**

- **Use `overlay2`** whenever possible.
  - It's the **default** on most modern Linux distros.
  - It's the **most efficient and stable** driver.
  - It has **better performance and lower overhead** than older drivers like `aufs` or `devicemapper`.
- Your **kernel must support it**: at least **Linux kernel 4.0+**, and an **xfs or ext4** file system with `d_type=true`.
- Donâ€™t manually set the storage driver unless:
  - Youâ€™re running on a specialized system.
  - You know another driver is better suited for your specific storage backend or workload.

âœ… **Best practice**: Stick to `overlay2` unless you have strong constraints or requirements.

---

### âœ… **Why would someone choose `devicemapper` over `overlay2`?**

You might use `devicemapper`:
- On **older kernels** or distros where `overlay2` isnâ€™t supported.
- In **device-mapped direct-lvm mode**, which offers **better performance and reliability** than loopback mode.
- When you want **more control over thin provisioning and block-level storage** (good for advanced use cases, like embedded systems or tightly managed production environments).
- If you're already using **LVM** or managing block devices with custom volume setups.

ðŸš« **Downside**: `devicemapper` is **harder to configure** and **deprecated for most new installs**.

---

### âœ… **When is `btrfs` or `zfs` appropriate?**

#### `btrfs`
- Use when you want:
  - **Built-in snapshotting and subvolume support**
  - **Compression, deduplication**
  - Advanced **filesystem-level features**
- Great for **testing**, research, or when your **underlying system already uses `btrfs`**.

#### `zfs`
- Use if:
  - Youâ€™re running **ZFS on root** already (common in FreeBSD, Ubuntu servers with ZFS setup)
  - You want **enterprise-grade features** like:
    - Snapshots
    - Checksumming
    - Self-healing
    - RAID-Z support
- ZFS requires separate setup and is not bundled with Linux by default (license issues).

ðŸš« Both are **not default** and are more **niche** unless your environment already runs on those filesystems.

---

### âœ… **Self-test Prompt: Which storage driver is best for your Linux distro and why?**

**Example answer** (letâ€™s say you're using Ubuntu 22.04):

> The best storage driver for Ubuntu 22.04 is `overlay2`, because:
> - It's the default and fully supported by Docker on this kernel version.
> - Ubuntu uses the ext4 filesystem by default, which works well with `overlay2` as long as `d_type=true`.
> - `overlay2` has better performance, lower resource usage, and less complexity than alternatives like `aufs` or `devicemapper`.
> - Itâ€™s actively maintained and recommended by Docker unless specific use cases require otherwise.

Would you like to try writing your own answer to the self-test prompt for your current distro setup? I can review or help fine-tune it!
