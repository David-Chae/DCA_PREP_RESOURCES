# Configuring Logging Drivers in Docker

## Overview
Docker provides multiple logging drivers that allow container logs to be collected, stored, and forwarded to various logging systems. Some commonly used logging drivers include:

- `json-file` (default)
- `journald`
- `syslog`
- `splunk`
- `fluentd`
- `awslogs`

## Configuring Logging Drivers
Docker logging drivers can be set either:
- Per-container
- Globally (daemon-level)

### 1. Setting a Logging Driver for a Container
To configure a logging driver for an individual container, use the `--log-driver` flag when running the container.

#### Example: Using `journald` Logging Driver
```sh
docker run --log-driver=journald --name mycontainer alpine echo "Hello, journald!"
```

#### Example: Using `splunk` Logging Driver
```sh
docker run --log-driver=splunk \
  --log-opt splunk-token="your-splunk-token" \
  --log-opt splunk-url="https://splunk-server:8088" \
  --log-opt splunk-insecureskipverify=true \
  --name mycontainer alpine echo "Hello, Splunk!"
```

### 2. Setting a Global Logging Driver
To configure a logging driver for all containers, modify the Docker daemon configuration file.

1. Open or create the `/etc/docker/daemon.json` file:
```sh
sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```
2. Add the following configuration:

#### Example: Using `journald`
```json
{
  "log-driver": "journald"
}
```

#### Example: Using `splunk`
```json
{
  "log-driver": "splunk",
  "log-opts": {
    "splunk-token": "your-splunk-token",
    "splunk-url": "https://splunk-server:8088",
    "splunk-insecureskipverify": "true"
  }
}
```

3. Restart Docker to apply changes:
```sh
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Verifying Logs
To verify logs collected by the logging driver:
- **journald**: Use `journalctl`
  ```sh
  journalctl -u docker.service --no-pager
  ```
- **splunk**: Check the Splunk UI or use the Splunk REST API.

## Documentation
For further details, refer to official documentation:
- Docker Logging Drivers: [https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/)
- Splunk Logging Driver: [https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/splunk/](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/splunk/)
- Journald Logging Driver: [https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/journald/](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/logging/journald/)

## Conclusion
Using appropriate logging drivers ensures effective monitoring and troubleshooting of Docker containers. Choosing between `journald`, `splunk`, or other options depends on your infrastructure and operational needs.


# SELF TEST

To **self-test** the DCA exam topic:

> **"Configure the default logging driver"**

You want to **verify understanding + apply changes in a real environment**. Here's a step-by-step plan to test yourself effectively:

---

## ✅ Self-Test Goals

### 🧠 Knowledge Check (Describe)
1. What is the **default** Docker logging driver?
2. How do you change the **default logging driver**?
3. Where is the configuration file located?
4. What are common `log-opts` you can set?
5. Do changes affect **existing** containers?
6. How do you verify the current logging driver?

---

### 🧪 Hands-on Practice (Demonstrate)

---

## 🔹 Step 1: View the current default logging driver

Run:
```bash
docker info --format '{{.LoggingDriver}}'
```

✅ Self-test:
- What logging driver is currently set?
- Is it `json-file` (default) or something else?

---

## 🔹 Step 2: Edit the Docker daemon config

Path: `/etc/docker/daemon.json`

### Example 1: Change default driver to `local`
```json
{
  "log-driver": "local"
}
```

### Example 2: Use `json-file` with log options
```json
{
  "log-driver": "json-file",
  "log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3",
    "labels": "production_status",
    "env": "os,customer"
  }
}
```

✅ Self-test:
- Can you modify `daemon.json` correctly?
- Do you know to use **quoted strings** for all `log-opts` values?

---

## 🔹 Step 3: Restart Docker

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

Then verify:
```bash
docker info | grep 'Logging Driver'
```

✅ Self-test:
- Did your change apply successfully?
- Did Docker start without syntax errors in `daemon.json`?

---

## 🔹 Step 4: Create a New Container & Check Logging Driver

```bash
docker run --name test-logger -d alpine sleep 1000
docker inspect test-logger --format '{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}'
```

✅ Self-test:
- Did the container use the default driver from `daemon.json`?

---

## 🔹 Step 5: Verify Options Are Applied (json-file example)

Inspect:
```bash
docker inspect test-logger | grep LogConfig -A 5
```

✅ Self-test:
- Do you see your `max-size`, `max-file`, etc. in the output?

---

## 🔹 Step 6: Test What Happens to Existing Containers

Before changing config:
```bash
docker run --name old-container -d alpine sleep 1000
```

Then change default logging driver (e.g. to `local`), restart Docker, and inspect:

```bash
docker inspect old-container --format '{{.HostConfig.LogConfig.Type}}'
```

✅ Self-test:
- Does the existing container still use the **old** logging driver?
- What do you need to do to apply the new driver? (Answer: recreate container)

---

## 📚 Review Prompts

- What happens if you misconfigure the `daemon.json` file?
- What’s the difference between `--log-driver` on `docker run` vs `daemon.json`?
- When would you use a driver like `local`, `json-file`, or `journald`?

---

## 📝 Bonus Challenge

- Configure your system to use `local` logging driver by default.
- Spin up a container.
- Write a script to check the logging driver of every running container and alert if it’s not `local`.
