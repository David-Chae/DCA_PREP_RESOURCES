# Describe and demonstrate how to set up swarm, configure managers, add nodes, and setup the backup schedule.

## Setting Up Docker Swarm

## Overview
Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool that allows you to manage a cluster of Docker nodes efficiently. It enables container scaling, service discovery, and load balancing.

## 1. Initializing the Swarm
To initialize a Docker Swarm, run the following command on the manager node:

```sh
docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
```

Example:
```sh
docker swarm init --advertise-addr 192.168.1.100
```
This command initializes the Swarm mode and designates the current node as the manager.

## 2. Adding Worker and Manager Nodes
Once the swarm is initialized, you can add worker or additional manager nodes.

### Add a Worker Node
On the manager node, run:
```sh
docker swarm join-token worker
```
This command will output a token and a command to run on worker nodes. Example:
```sh
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-xyz 192.168.1.100:2377
```
Run this command on worker nodes to join the swarm.

### Add a Manager Node
On the manager node, run:
```sh
docker swarm join-token manager
```
Example output:
```sh
docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-abc 192.168.1.100:2377
```
Run this command on the new manager node.

## 3. Verifying the Swarm Cluster
To check the nodes in the swarm, run:
```sh
docker node ls
```
This will display all nodes along with their roles (Manager/Worker).

## 4. Configuring a Backup Schedule for Swarm
It is crucial to back up the Swarm state, including services and configurations.

### Backup the Swarm State
1. On a manager node, create a backup directory:
   ```sh
   mkdir -p /backup/docker-swarm
   ```
2. Run the following command to back up the Swarm Raft database:
   ```sh
   cp -r /var/lib/docker/swarm /backup/docker-swarm/
   ```

### Automating Backup with a Cron Job
Create a cron job to schedule the backup.
```sh
crontab -e
```
Add the following line to back up every day at midnight:
```sh
0 0 * * * cp -r /var/lib/docker/swarm /backup/docker-swarm/
```

## 5. Restoring Swarm from Backup
To restore Swarm from a backup:
```sh
systemctl stop docker
rm -rf /var/lib/docker/swarm
cp -r /backup/docker-swarm /var/lib/docker/swarm
systemctl start docker
```
If necessary, reinitialize the cluster:
```sh
docker swarm init --force-new-cluster
```

## Conclusion
Setting up a Docker Swarm cluster allows for scalable container orchestration. By configuring managers, adding nodes, and implementing a backup strategy, you ensure a resilient and manageable containerized environment.
