# Troubleshooting Docker Installation Issues
Understanding error messages can help diagnose and resolve common Docker installation issues.

### Common Errors and Solutions
#### 1. **Docker Daemon Not Running**
- **Error:** `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon at unix:///var/run/docker.sock`
- **Solution:**
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl start docker
  sudo systemctl enable docker
  ```
  Verify the status:
  ```sh
  sudo systemctl status docker
  ```

#### 2. **Permission Denied When Running Docker**
- **Error:** `Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`
- **Solution:**
  ```sh
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  newgrp docker
  ```
  Log out and back in for changes to take effect.

#### 3. **Missing Dependencies**
- **Error:** `package docker-ce is not available`
- **Solution:** Ensure that the correct repository is added:
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
  ```

#### 4. **Port Conflicts**
- **Error:** `Error starting userland proxy: listen tcp 0.0.0.0:80: bind: address already in use`
- **Solution:** Identify and free up the port:
  ```sh
  sudo lsof -i :80
  sudo kill -9 <PID>
  ```
  Alternatively, start the container on a different port:
  ```sh
docker run -p 8080:80 my_container
  ```

The `lsof` command stands for **List Open Files**, and it's used in Unix/Linux systems to display information about files that are currently **open by processes**.
üîç What it does: Every file, directory, socket, or device that a process uses is considered an "open file" in Linux. `lsof` lets you see which processes are using which files.

üìå Common Use Cases:

| Command | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `lsof` | Lists **all** open files by **all** processes. |
| `lsof -i` | Lists open **network connections** (TCP, UDP). |
| `lsof -i :80` | Shows which process is using **port 80**. |
| `lsof /path/to/file` | Lists processes using a **specific file**. |
| `lsof -u username` | Lists open files for a specific **user**. |
| `lsof -p <PID>` | Lists files opened by a specific **process ID**. |
| `lsof +D /dir` | Lists files opened under a **directory** (can be slow). |

---

Example:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :2376
```
This would show which process is using port `2376` ‚Äî useful for debugging Docker daemon connectivity issues!


#### 5. **Storage Issues**
- **Error:** `no space left on device`
- **Solution:** Clear unused images and containers:
  ```sh
  docker system prune -a
  ```
  Verify disk usage:
  ```sh
  df -h
  ```
