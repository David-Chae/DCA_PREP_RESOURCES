# Setup of Repository, Selection of Storage Driver, and Installation of Docker Engine on Multiple Platforms

## Overview

This guide provides instructions on setting up a repository, selecting a storage driver, and installing Docker Engine on multiple platforms. It covers the necessary steps for Linux, Windows, and macOS.

## Setting Up a Repository

### Linux

1. **Add Docker's Official GPG Key**:
    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

2. **Add Docker Repository**:
    ```bash
    sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
    ```

3. **Update Package Repository**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    ```

### Windows

1. **Download Docker Desktop**:
    - Visit the Docker website and download Docker Desktop for Windows.

2. **Install Docker Desktop**:
    - Follow the installation wizard to install Docker Desktop.

### macOS

1. **Download Docker Desktop**:
    - Visit the Docker website and download Docker Desktop for macOS.

2. **Install Docker Desktop**:
    - Follow the installation wizard to install Docker Desktop.

## Selection of a Storage Driver

### Overview

Docker supports several storage drivers. The choice of storage driver affects performance, stability, and compatibility. The most commonly used storage drivers are:

- **overlay2**: Default and recommended for most Linux distributions.
- **aufs**: Older driver, still available for backward compatibility.
- **btrfs**: Supports advanced features like snapshots and compression.
- **devicemapper**: Used for older systems or specific use cases.
- **vfs**: Intended for testing purposes.

### Choosing a Storage Driver

To select a storage driver, edit the Docker daemon configuration file (`/etc/docker/daemon.json`). Add the following configuration:

```json
{
  "storage-driver": "overlay2"
}
```

Restart the Docker daemon to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

## Installation of Docker Engine

### Linux

1. **Install Docker Engine**:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
    ```

2. **Verify Installation**:
    ```bash
    docker --version
    ```

### Windows

1. **Install Docker Desktop**:
    - Follow the installation wizard to install Docker Desktop.

2. **Verify Installation**:
    - Open Docker Desktop and check the version.

### macOS

1. **Install Docker Desktop**:
    - Follow the installation wizard to install Docker Desktop.

2. **Verify Installation**:
    - Open Docker Desktop and check the version.
