# Creating and Managing Users and Teams in Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP)

## Overview
Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP) is a container management platform that allows organizations to deploy and secure Docker containers at scale. UCP provides role-based access control (RBAC) for managing users and teams.

## 1. Creating a User in UCP

### Using the UCP Web UI:
1. Log in to the UCP web interface as an administrator.
2. Navigate to **Access Control** > **Users**.
3. Click on **Create User**.
4. Enter the **Username**, **Full Name**, **Password**, and optionally, an **Email**.
5. Assign appropriate roles to the user.
6. Click **Create**.

### Using the UCP CLI:
Run the following command to create a new user:
```sh
curl -k -X POST "https://<UCP-URL>/accounts" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "name": "newuser", "password": "securepassword", "fullName": "New User" }'
```

## 2. Managing Users

### List Users
```sh
curl -k -X GET "https://<UCP-URL>/accounts" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>"
```

### Delete a User
```sh
curl -k -X DELETE "https://<UCP-URL>/accounts/newuser" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>"
```

## 3. Creating and Managing Teams

### Creating a Team
1. Navigate to **Access Control** > **Teams**.
2. Click on **Create Team**.
3. Provide a **Team Name**.
4. Assign users to the team.
5. Click **Create**.

### Using the CLI:
```sh
curl -k -X POST "https://<UCP-URL>/teams" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "name": "DevTeam", "description": "Development Team" }'
```

### Adding a User to a Team
```sh
curl -k -X POST "https://<UCP-URL>/teams/DevTeam/members" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{ "username": "newuser" }'
```

### Removing a User from a Team
```sh
curl -k -X DELETE "https://<UCP-URL>/teams/DevTeam/members/newuser" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer <API-TOKEN>"
```

## 4. Assigning Roles and Permissions
UCP allows you to assign roles at different levels:
- **Organization level** (e.g., Admin, Restricted Control)
- **Team level** (e.g., Owner, Member)
- **Resource level** (e.g., access to specific applications or services)

To assign a role to a user, go to **Access Control** > **Users** and select the user to modify their role.

## Conclusion
Managing users and teams in Docker UCP allows organizations to enforce security policies and ensure appropriate access control. By leveraging RBAC, administrators can efficiently manage permissions and user roles.
