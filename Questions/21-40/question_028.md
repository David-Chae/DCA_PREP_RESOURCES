## What tool should we use to manage a multi-container application as a unit on a single Docker host? 
1. We should use Docker Compose. 
2. We should execute docker-run. 
3. We should use a Docker stack. 
4. We should use Docker Swarm.

The correct tool to manage a multi-container application as a unit on a single Docker host is:

**We should use Docker Compose.**

### **Explanation:**
- **Docker Compose** is specifically designed to define and manage multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define services, networks, and volumes in a `docker-compose.yml` file and then bring up the application with a single command (`docker-compose up`). It is typically used for managing containers on a single Docker host.

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**
1. **We should execute docker-run**:
   - `docker run` is used to run individual containers but not to manage multiple containers as a unit.

2. **We should use a Docker stack**:
   - Docker stacks are used in Docker Swarm mode to manage multi-container applications across multiple nodes, not for single-host deployments.

3. **We should use Docker Swarm**:
   - Docker Swarm is used for orchestrating and managing clusters of Docker nodes, not just single Docker hosts.

Therefore, for managing multi-container applications on a single host, **Docker Compose** is the most appropriate tool.
