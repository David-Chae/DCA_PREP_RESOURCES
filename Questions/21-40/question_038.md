## Dave needs Docker to use a custom stop signal for halting his software. How can he build an image instructing Docker on which stop signal to use? 
1. Dave should locate the process and kill it manually. 
2. Dave should use the STOPSIGNAL directive. 
3. Dave should use the docker stop command. 
4. Dave should use the STOP directive.

The correct answer is:  

✅ **Dave should use the `STOPSIGNAL` directive.**  

### **Explanation:**  
- In a **Dockerfile**, the `STOPSIGNAL` directive **specifies which system signal** should be sent to the container's main process when stopping the container.  
- By default, Docker sends **SIGTERM** to stop a container, but some applications may need a different signal, like **SIGKILL** or **SIGHUP**.  
- Example usage in a **Dockerfile**:  
  ```dockerfile
  FROM ubuntu
  STOPSIGNAL SIGQUIT
  CMD ["my-app"]
  ```  
  - This ensures that when `docker stop` is used, **SIGQUIT** is sent instead of the default **SIGTERM**.  

### **Why the Other Options Are Incorrect:**  
❌ **"Dave should locate the process and kill it manually."**  
- This is inefficient and **not automated**. Docker provides built-in ways to handle process termination.  

❌ **"Dave should use the `docker stop` command."**  
- `docker stop` sends the stop signal but does **not define** which signal should be used. The `STOPSIGNAL` directive defines it **inside the image**.  

❌ **"Dave should use the `STOP` directive."**  
- There is **no `STOP` directive** in Docker. The correct directive is `STOPSIGNAL`.  

### **Final Answer:**  
✅ **"Dave should use the `STOPSIGNAL` directive."**
