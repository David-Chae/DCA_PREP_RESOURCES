## 22. How would we back up Docker Swarm?
```sh
A. On a Swarm manager, make a backup of the contents of /etc/docker.
B. On a Swarm manager, make a backup of the contents of /var/lib/docker/swarm
C. Back up all of the containers in the swarm's tiered file systems.
D. On a Swarm manager, make a backup of the contents of /etc/docker/swarm.
```

The correct answer is **B. On a Swarm manager, make a backup of the contents of /var/lib/docker/swarm**.

Docker Swarm's state is stored in the `/var/lib/docker/swarm` directory on Swarm managers. This directory contains the data necessary for the Swarm cluster to operate, including cryptographic keys, certificates, and cluster configuration. Backing up this directory ensures that you can restore the cluster's state if needed.

Here’s why the other options are incorrect:

- **Option A: On a Swarm manager, make a backup of the contents of `/etc/docker`.**  
   This is incorrect because the `/etc/docker` directory typically contains configuration files related to Docker Engine itself, not the state of the Swarm cluster. While backing up this directory might preserve Docker Engine settings, it won't include essential Swarm-specific information such as cryptographic keys, certificates, or cluster configurations.

- **Option C: Back up all of the containers in the Swarm's tiered file systems.**  
   This is incorrect because backing up container filesystems does not provide a way to restore the Swarm cluster configuration or its state. Swarm's functionality, including orchestration, node membership, and encrypted communication, is tied to the data stored specifically in the `/var/lib/docker/swarm` directory.

- **Option D: On a Swarm manager, make a backup of the contents of `/etc/docker/swarm`.**  
   This is incorrect because there is no such directory as `/etc/docker/swarm` in the Docker filesystem hierarchy. The Swarm-specific data is located in `/var/lib/docker/swarm`, making this option invalid.

### Key Takeaway
The correct directory to back up for preserving Docker Swarm’s state is **`/var/lib/docker/swarm`**. This ensures you retain critical information needed to restore the Swarm cluster.
