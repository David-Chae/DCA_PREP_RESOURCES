## 120. Which of the following is the virtual machine used to run Docker applications?
A. Docker Compose  
B. Docker Swarm  
C. Docker Stack  
D. Docker Volume  

None of the options listed are virtual machines used to run Docker applications. However, if you are referring to a lightweight virtual machine that can be used to run Docker, the correct answer should be **Docker Machine** (which is not listed).  

But if you are asking about orchestrating and managing Docker containers, the closest option would be:  

**B. Docker Swarm** â€“ It is used for clustering and orchestrating Docker containers but is not a virtual machine itself.  

### **Final Answer:**  
**None of the given options correctly describe a virtual machine for running Docker applications.** If you're asking about container orchestration, the best option is **Docker Swarm**.
