## 196. Can this sequence of the given commands determine a container's published port(s)?
## docker port inspect , docker container inspect  
A. Yes  
B. No  

**B. No**

The correct command to determine a container's published port(s) would be `docker port <container_id>` (or `docker container port <container_id>`). `docker container inspect` provides detailed information about the container, but not specifically the published ports. The correct sequence for determining published ports is just using `docker port` or `docker container port`.
