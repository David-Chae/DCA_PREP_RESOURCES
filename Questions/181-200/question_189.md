## 189. You wish to give a container a configuration file during runtime. Is the given set of Kubernetes tools and steps sufficient?
## Steps: Convert the configuration file to a configMap object, populate a volume associated with the pod, and mount the file from the volume to the proper container and path.
A. Yes
B. No

**A. Yes**  

### Explanation:  
In Kubernetes, you can provide a container with a configuration file at runtime by following these steps:  

1. **Convert the Configuration File to a ConfigMap:**  
   ```bash
   kubectl create configmap my-config --from-file=config.yaml
   ```

2. **Define a Pod that Uses the ConfigMap as a Volume:**  
   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Pod
   metadata:
     name: my-pod
   spec:
     containers:
     - name: my-container
       image: my-image
       volumeMounts:
       - name: config-volume
         mountPath: /etc/config  # Path inside the container
     volumes:
     - name: config-volume
       configMap:
         name: my-config
   ```

3. **Deploy the Pod:**  
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f my-pod.yaml
   ```

4. **Verify the Mounted File in the Container:**  
   ```bash
   kubectl exec -it my-pod -- cat /etc/config/config.yaml
   ```

This process ensures that the container receives the configuration file dynamically at runtime, making it **sufficient** for the requirement.
