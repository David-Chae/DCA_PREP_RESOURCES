## 199. Analyzing images for security vulnerabilities is a UCP function
A. Yes  
B. No  

**B. No**

199. Answer: B
Explanation: UCP does not do image scanning to detect security vulnerabilities. UCP is a web-based
user interface for managing Docker Enterprise clusters and applications. UCP does not support image scanning, but it does integrate with Docker Trusted Registry (DTR), which does as part of its security features.
