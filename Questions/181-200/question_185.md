## 185. What is the primary benefit of using Docker Compose in a development environment?
A. Simplifying the management of a single container  
B. Running containers in production  
C. Orchestrating containers in a cluster  
D. Defining and running multi-container applications  

**D. Defining and running multi-container applications**  

### Explanation:  
Docker Compose is primarily used for defining and running multi-container applications in a development environment. It allows developers to:  
- Define multiple containers in a **single YAML file** (`docker-compose.yml`).  
- **Manage dependencies** between services (e.g., a web app and a database).  
- **Easily start, stop, and scale** containers with simple commands like `docker-compose up` and `docker-compose down`.  
- Ensure **consistent development environments** across teams.  

#### Why not the other options?  
- **A. Simplifying the management of a single container** → Docker Compose is mainly for multi-container applications, not just one.  
- **B. Running containers in production** → While Compose can be used in production, it's mainly designed for **development and testing**. Tools like **Docker Swarm** or **Kubernetes** are better suited for production orchestration.  
- **C. Orchestrating containers in a cluster** → **Docker Swarm** or **Kubernetes** handle container orchestration at a cluster level, not Docker Compose.
