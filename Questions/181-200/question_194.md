A. Yes  
B. No  

**A. Yes**

It is possible to configure the Docker engine to use a registry that does not have a trusted TLS certificate. This can be done by adding the registry's address to the Docker daemon's configuration file and setting the `--insecure-registry` option to allow Docker to communicate with the registry without validating its TLS certificate. However, this is not recommended for production environments due to security concerns.
