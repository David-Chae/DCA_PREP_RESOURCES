## Question: Which mechanism in Docker Content Trust ensures the verification of both the integrity and the authenticity of data received from a registry, regardless of the communication channel used?
### Docker Content Trust: Ensuring Integrity and Authenticity

```sh
1. End-to-end encryption
2. Digital signatures
3. Symmetric key encryption
4. Container
```

### Correct Answer:
✅ **Digital signatures**  

### Explanation:
**Docker Content Trust (DCT)** ensures that only **signed and verified** images are pulled and run. It uses **digital signatures** to guarantee both:

1️⃣ **Integrity** → Ensures that the image has not been **tampered with**.  
2️⃣ **Authenticity** → Verifies that the image comes from a **trusted source**.  

Each time an image is signed, a cryptographic **digital signature** is generated using **Notary** and stored in a trust repository. When an image is pulled, Docker verifies this signature before allowing execution.

### Why Other Options Are Incorrect:
❌ **End-to-end encryption**  
   - Ensures **secure transmission** of data but **does not verify authenticity** of images.  

❌ **Symmetric key encryption**  
   - Uses a **shared key** for encryption and decryption but is **not used** in Docker Content Trust.  

❌ **Container**  
   - A **container** is an instance of an image and does **not play a role** in verifying integrity/authenticity.  

---

### Final Summary:
**Digital signatures** in **Docker Content Trust** ensure that images are **verified and untampered**, **regardless of the communication channel** used.
