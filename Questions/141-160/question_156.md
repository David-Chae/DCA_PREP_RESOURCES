## 156. Which of the following describes grants under the UCP?
A. images, containers, and nodes  
B. subject, role, and containers  
C. nodes, role, and containers  
D. subject, node, and container  
E. subject, role, and resource set  

The correct answer is:

**E. subject, role, and resource set**

Explanation:
In Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP), grants consist of three key components:
1. **Subject**: The user or entity to which the grant is being assigned.
2. **Role**: The permissions that define what actions the subject can perform (e.g., admin, read-only).
3. **Resource Set**: The resources the role applies to, such as containers, nodes, or services.

These three components together define access control and permissions in UCP.
