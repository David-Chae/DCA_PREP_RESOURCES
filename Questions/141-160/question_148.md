## 148. Which of the following daemon arguments is used for troubleshooting?
A. seccomp  
B. debug  
C. selinux  
D. bridge  

The correct answer is:

**B. debug**

The `debug` daemon argument is used to enable debug mode in Docker. When enabled, it provides more detailed logging, which is helpful for troubleshooting and diagnosing issues.

- `seccomp` is used to define security profiles.
- `selinux` is related to security contexts and policies in Docker.
- `bridge` is related to the Docker network mode.

So, **debug** is the argument specifically used for troubleshooting.
