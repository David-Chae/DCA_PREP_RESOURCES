## 150. Which of the following is used to execute code in a Docker container?  
A. Registry  
B. Images  
C. Module  
D. Containers  

The correct answer is:  

**D. Containers**  

Containers are the running instances of Docker images. They are used to execute code, as they encapsulate the application and its environment. When you run a container, it executes the code defined within its image in an isolated environment.  

Here's a breakdown of the other options:  
- **A. Registry**: A Docker registry stores Docker images, but it is not responsible for executing code.  
- **B. Images**: Docker images are templates or blueprints for creating containers, but they do not execute code by themselves.  
- **C. Module**: This is not a term specifically used in Docker to describe executing code.  

Therefore, **Containers** are used to execute code in a Docker environment.
