## 150. Which of the following is used to execute code in a Docker container?  
A. Registry  
B. Images  
C. Module  
D. Containers  

The correct answer is:  
**B** 
**Explanation**
A Docker image is a Docker container file to run code. Like a template, Docker images serve as instructions for constructing a container. When utilizing Docker, Docker images also serve as a starting point. In Virtual Machine (VM) environments, an image resembles a snapshot.

This question is a bit broad and could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If the intended answer was **B. Images**, the question should have been framed to specifically highlight what is used to store and define code that will later be executed in a container.

Hereâ€™s how the question could be rewritten for better clarity:

**"Which of the following is used to define and store the code that will be executed in a Docker container?"**

This rewording would clarify that **Docker Images** are responsible for containing and defining the application code and dependencies, which is later executed inside a Docker container. 

### Here's the breakdown:
- **Docker Image** is used to define the environment and the code that will be run inside a container.
- **Docker Container** is what actually runs the code based on the image.

By rewording the question to focus on storage and definition of code, the answer **B. Images** becomes more intuitive.
