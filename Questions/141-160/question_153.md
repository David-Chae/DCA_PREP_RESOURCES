## 153. Which of the following claims concerning multi-stage builds is FALSE?  
A. Separate Dockerfiles are not needed for multi-stage builds.  
B. Smaller image sizes can be produced with the use of multi-stage constructions.  
C. Once all stages have been established for a multi-stage build, you cannot choose which step to begin the build process  
D. You can make images using multi-stage builds for various uses, including development and pro-duction.  

The correct answer is:

**C. Once all stages have been established for a multi-stage build, you cannot choose which step to begin the build process**

Explanation:
- **A. Separate Dockerfiles are not needed for multi-stage builds.**  
  This statement is **true**. Multi-stage builds allow you to use a single Dockerfile to define multiple stages of the build process, eliminating the need for separate Dockerfiles.

- **B. Smaller image sizes can be produced with the use of multi-stage constructions.**  
  This statement is **true**. By using multi-stage builds, you can copy only the necessary artifacts from earlier stages into the final image, reducing the final image size by excluding intermediate build dependencies.

- **C. Once all stages have been established for a multi-stage build, you cannot choose which step to begin the build process.**  
  This statement is **false**. In Docker, you can specify a particular stage to begin the build process using the `--target` flag. This allows you to start the build from any specific stage rather than from the beginning.

- **D. You can make images using multi-stage builds for various uses, including development and production.**  
  This statement is **true**. Multi-stage builds enable the creation of different images for development (e.g., with build tools) and production (e.g., minimal runtime environments), all within the same Dockerfile.

So, **C** is the false statement.
