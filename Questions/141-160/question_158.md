158. Which of the following provides a web dashboard for managing a docker cluster?
```sh
A. Docker UCP
B. DTR
C. Docker swarm mode
D. Docker-compose
```

The correct answer is:

### ✅ **A. Docker UCP (Universal Control Plane)**

---

### Let's break down each option for clarity in **DOMC (Discrete Option Multiple Choice)** style:

---

#### **A. Docker UCP – ✅ True**
- **Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP)** is a **web-based UI/dashboard** provided by Docker Enterprise.
- It allows you to **manage Docker clusters**, including nodes, services, containers, networks, and more.
- UCP integrates with Docker Swarm and Kubernetes.
- ✅ **Correct answer.**

---

#### **B. DTR (Docker Trusted Registry) – ❌ False**
- DTR is used for **storing and managing Docker images securely**, not for managing clusters.
- It’s often used **alongside UCP**, but **not a dashboard for cluster management**.

---

#### **C. Docker Swarm Mode – ❌ False**
- Docker Swarm mode provides **native clustering** and orchestration features.
- It is a **feature** of Docker Engine, not a web dashboard.
- It enables you to manage containers across multiple hosts using the CLI.

---

#### **D. Docker Compose – ❌ False**
- Docker Compose is a **tool for defining and running multi-container applications** using a YAML file.
- It is used locally for development and is **not used for managing Docker clusters**, nor does it offer a web interface.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:
**A. Docker UCP** provides a web dashboard for managing a Docker cluster.
