## 94. Which of the following statements most accurately sums up the process for backing up metadata from the Universal Control Plane (UCP)?
A. Run the uninstall-ucp command in a container from the ucp image  
B. Create an archive for all the data in the directory /var/data/ucp.  
C. Create an archive for all the data in the directory /etc/docker/ucp  
D. The backup command can run a container from the ucp image  

The correct answer is:  

✅ **D. The backup command can run a container from the UCP image**  

---

### Explanation:

- **Universal Control Plane (UCP)** is a component of Docker Enterprise for managing clusters.
- To back up UCP metadata, Docker provides a **backup command** that runs a container from the **UCP image**.

#### Breakdown of the given options:

| Option | Command | Correct? | Explanation |
|---------|------------------------------------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **A** | `Run the uninstall-ucp command in a container from the ucp image` | ❌ Incorrect | `uninstall-ucp` is used to **remove UCP**, not to back it up. |
| **B** | `Create an archive for all the data in the directory /var/data/ucp.` | ❌ Incorrect | The backup process does not rely solely on `/var/data/ucp`. |
| **C** | `Create an archive for all the data in the directory /etc/docker/ucp` | ❌ Incorrect | `/etc/docker/ucp` is not the primary directory for UCP backups. |
| **D** | `The backup command can run a container from the ucp image` | ✅ **Correct** | UCP provides a `docker container run` command using the `ucp` image to create a backup. |

---

### How to back up UCP:
You can back up UCP using the following command:

```sh
docker container run --rm -v $(pwd):/backup docker/ucp backup --passphrase "your-passphrase" > ucp-backup.tar
```

- This runs a container from the **UCP image**.
- It saves the backup as a `.tar` file.
- The passphrase encrypts the backup.

Thus, **option D is the most accurate description** of the backup process. ✅
