## 99. Which of the following allows users to deploy images confidently?
A. Daemon  
B. Virtual network  
C. Docker Content Trust  
D. Simulator  

The correct answer is:

**C. Docker Content Trust**

### **Explanation:**

**Docker Content Trust (DCT)** is a security feature that ensures the authenticity and integrity of images before they are deployed. When enabled, DCT uses digital signatures to verify that images come from trusted sources and haven't been tampered with. This allows users to deploy images confidently, knowing they are verified and safe to use.

Here’s a breakdown of the other options:

1. **A. Daemon**: The Docker daemon is the background service that manages Docker containers, images, and other resources, but it doesn't directly relate to securely deploying images.

2. **B. Virtual network**: A virtual network in Docker is used for container communication, but it doesn’t directly ensure confidence in image deployment.

3. **D. Simulator**: A simulator is a tool for testing or simulating environments but doesn’t specifically address secure deployment of images.
