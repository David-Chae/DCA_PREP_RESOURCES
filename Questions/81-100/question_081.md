## The /my/path directory on the host can be mounted to a container using which of the following commands? (Select two)?
A. docker run -v /my/path:/tmp nginx  
B. docker run --mount source=new-volume,hostpath=/my/path,destination=/tmp nginx  
C. docker run --mount source=/my/path,destination=/tmp nginx  
D. docker run --mount source=new-volume,destination=/tmp nginx  

The correct answers are:  

‚úî **A. `docker run -v /my/path:/tmp nginx`**  

---

### **Explanation:**  

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Option A (`-v` flag) ‚Üí Correct ‚úÖ**  
- The **`-v` (volume) option** is a legacy method to mount directories.  
- **Syntax:** `-v <host-path>:<container-path>`  
- In this case, `/my/path` (host) is mounted to `/tmp` (container).  
- **Works correctly** and is still widely used.

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Option D (`--mount` with a named volume) ‚Üí Incorrect ‚úÖ**  
- **`--mount`** is the modern method, offering more options and clarity.  
- `source=new-volume` refers to a **named volume**, not a host directory.  
- `destination=/tmp` mounts it inside the container.  
- This is **incorrect for using a named volume**, it does not map `/my/path`.  

---

### **Why are the other options incorrect?**  

#### **‚ùå Option B (`--mount` with `hostpath` instead of `type=bind`)**  
- **Incorrect Syntax:** `hostpath=/my/path` is **not a valid parameter**.  
- Correct syntax should be:  
  ```bash
  docker run --mount type=bind,source=/my/path,target=/tmp nginx
  ```  

You're right to double-check! However, the command you provided isn't quite correct according to the official Docker documentation. Let's clarify it properly.

### Correct Syntax for Mounting a Host Directory:
To mount `/my/path` from the host to `/tmp` in the container, you should use the **`--mount`** flag with `type=bind`. The correct command is:

```sh
docker run --mount type=bind,source=/my/path,target=/tmp nginx
```

### Why?  
- `type=bind`: Specifies that this is a **bind mount** (mounting a host directory, not a Docker volume).
- `source=/my/path`: The **absolute path** on the host.
- `target=/tmp`: The **path inside the container**.

Your command:
```sh
docker run --mount source=/my/path,destination=/tmp nginx
```
**won't work** because:
- `source=` in `--mount` is used for named volumes, not host paths.
- `destination=` should be `target=`.

### Correct Answers:
‚úÖ **A. `docker run -v /my/path:/tmp nginx`**  
‚úÖ **(Corrected version of C)** `docker run --mount type=bind,source=/my/path,target=/tmp nginx`
