## 88. Which of the following statements concerning private Docker registries is accurate?
A. We cannot protect a private registry With Docker Community Edition (CE).  
B. By launching a container with the registry image, we may establish our registry.  
C. We require a Docker EE license to create our private registry.  
D. A Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) must be present to create a private registry.  

The correct answer is:

✔ **B. By launching a container with the registry image, we may establish our registry.**

---

### **Explanation:**

- **Option B** is correct because you can create a private Docker registry by simply using the official **Docker registry image**. Running this containerized registry allows you to have a private registry for storing your images. This is possible in both Docker CE (Community Edition) and Docker EE (Enterprise Edition).

---

### **Why the other options are incorrect:**

- **❌ Option A (`We cannot protect a private registry with Docker Community Edition (CE)`)**:
  - This is incorrect. You can protect a private registry using Docker CE by implementing security features like **TLS encryption**, **basic authentication**, or other methods, without needing Docker EE.

- **❌ Option C (`We require a Docker EE license to create our private registry`)**:
  - This is incorrect. Docker CE allows the creation of a private registry, so you do not need Docker EE for this. Docker EE provides additional enterprise features, but a private registry can be created with Docker CE.

- **❌ Option D (`A Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) must be present to create a private registry`)**:
  - This is incorrect. While **Docker Trusted Registry (DTR)** is an advanced solution for managing private registries with enhanced security and integration features in Docker EE, it is **not required** to create a private registry. A simple private registry can be set up with Docker CE.

---

### **Final Answer:**
✔ **B. By launching a container with the registry image, we may establish our registry.**
