## 202. DTR security scan will pick up on licenses for known third-party binary components
A. Yes  
B. No  

**Answer: B**

Explanation: A DTR (Docker Trusted Registry) security scan typically identifies vulnerabilities and security issues in container images, including their dependencies and libraries. It may not directly pick up licenses for known third-party binary components, as its primary focus is security rather than license compliance.
