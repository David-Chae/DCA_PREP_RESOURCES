## 201. Will the given procedure entirely erase an image from the Docker Trusted Registry's disk?
## Remove the image from the Docker Trusted Registry and the image repository.
A. Yes  
B. No  

**B. No**  

Simply removing the image from the Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) and the image repository does not necessarily erase it entirely from disk. DTR may retain layers of the image due to garbage collection policies. To completely remove the image, you may need to run a **garbage collection** process in DTR to free up the storage.
