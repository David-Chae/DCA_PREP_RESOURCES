## 217. How to view the current unlock key for the running swarm?
A. docker swarm unlock-key  
B. docker swarm show-key  
C. docker swarm view-unlock-key  
D. docker swarm display-key  

The correct answer is:

**A. docker swarm unlock-key**

### Explanation:
- The `docker swarm unlock-key` command **displays the unlock key** for the Docker Swarm in case autolock is enabled. This key is required to unlock the swarm if it has been locked after a restart.

### Why the other options are incorrect:
- **B**, **C**, and **D** are incorrect because these are not valid Docker commands for viewing the unlock key. The correct command is `docker swarm unlock-key`.
