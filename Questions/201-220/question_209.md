## 209. How to add another manager to the swarm?
A. docker swarm join-token manager  
B. docker swarm add-manager  
C. docker swarm create-manager  
D. docker manager add  

The correct answer is:  

✅ **A. `docker swarm join-token manager`**  

### Explanation:  
- **`docker swarm join-token manager`** generates a command that can be used on another node to add it as a manager to the existing Swarm. The generated command will include a token that allows the new node to join as a manager in the swarm.  
- You then run the generated command on the new node to add it to the Swarm as a manager.

### Eliminations:  
❌ **B. `docker swarm add-manager`**  
- Incorrect. This is not a valid Docker command.  

❌ **C. `docker swarm create-manager`**  
- Incorrect. There is no such command as `docker swarm create-manager`. The correct way to add a manager is by using the join-token command.  

❌ **D. `docker manager add`**  
- Incorrect. This is not a valid Docker command either. The correct approach is to use `docker swarm join-token manager`.
