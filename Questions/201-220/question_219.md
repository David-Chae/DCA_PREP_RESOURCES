## 219. If the key was rotated after one of the management nodes went down, and you do not have access to the old key, you may need to force the manager to quit the swarm and rejoin it as a new manager. 
Is this statement correct?
A. Yes.
B. No, if the key was rotated and the prior key is no longer accessible, it is not possible to compel a manager to quit the swarm and rejoin as a new manager.
C. This statement is partially correct. You can force a manager to leave the swarm, but it cannot join back as a new manager
D. Forcing a manager to leave the swarm is unnecessary if the key was rotated; alternative methods exist to resolve the issue.

The correct answer is:

**A. Yes.**

### Explanation:
- If a key was rotated and a management node went down, and the old key is no longer accessible, it may be necessary to **force the manager node to quit the swarm** and then **rejoin the swarm as a new manager**. This is required because the new unlock key is needed for the swarm to be accessed, and without it, the node cannot participate as a manager in the swarm until it rejoins. 

This situation can arise if the key was rotated and the previous key is lost, making it impossible for the node to communicate with the swarm securely.

### Why the other options are incorrect:
- **B. No, if the key was rotated and the prior key is no longer accessible, it is not possible to compel a manager to quit the swarm and rejoin as a new manager**: This is incorrect because it is indeed possible to force a manager node to quit and rejoin as a new manager.
- **C. This statement is partially correct. You can force a manager to leave the swarm, but it cannot join back as a new manager**: This is incorrect because once the manager quits, it can rejoin the swarm as a manager, assuming the necessary steps are followed.
- **D. Forcing a manager to leave the swarm is unnecessary if the key was rotated; alternative methods exist to resolve the issue**: This is incorrect because, in this case, forcing the manager to leave and rejoin as a new manager is the necessary step to resolve the issue if the key is no longer accessible.
