## What part of the Docker Container Networking Model (CNM) assigns IP addresses to networks using Docker containers? 
A. This is the responsibility of the IP Address Management (IPAM) Driver.  
B. The Docker network causes it.  
C. Responsible is the network driver.  
D. Responsible is a Docker Swarm manager.  


**The correct answer is:  

✔ **A. This is the responsibility of the IP Address Management (IPAM) Driver.**  

### **Explanation:**  
In Docker's **Container Networking Model (CNM)**, the **IP Address Management (IPAM) Driver** is responsible for assigning **IP addresses** to networks that use Docker containers.  

- **IPAM (IP Address Management) Driver**:  
  - It **allocates and manages** IP addresses for containers in a Docker network.  
  - It can be **built-in** (default IPAM driver) or **custom** (third-party plugins).  
  - Used with both **bridge** and **overlay** networks.  

### **Why are the other options incorrect?**  

1. **B. The Docker network causes it.** ❌  
   - Incorrect because a **Docker network** itself does not assign IP addresses. It is the **IPAM driver** that handles IP allocation.

2. **C. Responsible is the network driver.** ❌  
   - Partially correct but not precise. The **network driver** is responsible for handling **how** networking works (e.g., bridge, overlay, macvlan), but **IP assignment** is done by the **IPAM driver**.

3. **D. Responsible is a Docker Swarm manager.** ❌  
   - Incorrect because the **Swarm manager** schedules tasks and manages services, but it does not handle **IP address allocation** for individual containers.  

### **Final Answer:**  
✔ **A. This is the responsibility of the IP Address Management (IPAM) Driver.****
