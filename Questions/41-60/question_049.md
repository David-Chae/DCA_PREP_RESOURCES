## 49. Which of the following statements about the none network driver is accurate?
```sh
A. The none driver implements communication between containers.
B. The none driver implements sandboxes
C. The none driver does not provide network isolation between containers.
D. The none driver is the default when no driver is selected
```

The correct answer is:  

**B. The none driver implements sandboxes**  

### Explanation:  
The **`none` network driver** essentially disables networking for containers and isolates them from any network stack. This is often used when you want to completely control networking externally or don't want the container to have any network capabilities. It's useful for scenarios where the container doesn't need to communicate with others or the outside world. 

- It creates a **network sandbox** for the container but doesn't allow network communication.

### Why not the others?  
- **A**: The `none` driver does not implement communication between containers; it disables networking entirely.  
- **C**: The `none` driver does provide isolation in the sense that it prevents networking entirely, not enabling communication between containers.  
- **D**: The **default driver** is typically `bridge`, not `none`, unless specified otherwise.
