## Which of the following commands can help us find the real files that a container uses to store its internal data? 
A. docker image inspect <image>  
B. docker container inspect volume ls  
C. docker volume ls  
D. docker container inspect <container>  



The correct answer is:  

✔ **D. `docker container inspect <container>`**  

### **Explanation:**  
The `docker container inspect <container>` command provides **detailed metadata** about a container, including:  
- The **mount points** (volumes and bind mounts)  
- The **file paths** used for persistent storage  
- The **container's configuration** and runtime settings  

By running:  
```sh
docker container inspect <container>
```
You can find the **real files** stored on the host system under the `"Mounts"` section in the output.

### **Why are the other options incorrect?**  

1. **A. `docker image inspect <image>`** ❌  
   - This inspects a **Docker image**, showing metadata like layers and environment variables, but **not runtime storage details**.  

2. **B. `docker container inspect volume ls`** ❌  
   - This command is **invalid syntax**. There is no `volume ls` option with `docker container inspect`.  

3. **C. `docker volume ls`** ❌  
   - This **lists Docker volumes** on the system but does not show which **real files** a container is using.

### **Final Answer:**  
✔ **D. `docker container inspect <container>`**
