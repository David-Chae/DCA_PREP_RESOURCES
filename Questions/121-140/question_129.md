## 129. Which of the following is a docker orchestration?
```sh
A. Terraform
B. Ansible
C. Kubernetes
D. Github
```

The correct answer is:  

**C. Kubernetes**  

### Explanation:  
**Kubernetes** is a popular container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It is often used in conjunction with Docker to manage large-scale container environments.

### Why not the others?  
- **A. Terraform**: Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code tool used for provisioning and managing infrastructure but not for container orchestration.
- **B. Ansible**: Ansible is an automation tool used for configuration management, deployment, and task automation, but it is not a container orchestration platform.
- **D. Github**: GitHub is a code hosting and version control platform, not an orchestration tool for containers.
