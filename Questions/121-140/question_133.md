## 133. Which of the following is used to split the app code into numerous independently running services?
```sh
A. Docker Compose 
B. Docker Stack  
C. Docker Swarm  
D. None of the Above  
```

The correct answer is:  

**A. Docker Compose**  

- **Docker Compose** is used to define and run **multi-container applications** using a `docker-compose.yml` file.  
- It allows developers to split application code into **multiple independently running services**, making it easier to manage microservices-based applications.  
- Each service runs in its own container and can be scaled independently.
