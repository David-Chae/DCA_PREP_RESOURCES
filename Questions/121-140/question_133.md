## 133. Which of the following is used to split the app code into numerous independently running services?
```sh
A. Docker Compose 
B. Docker Stack  
C. Docker Swarm  
D. None of the Above  
```

The correct answer is:  

**A. Docker Compose**  

- **Docker Compose** is used to define and run **multi-container applications** using a `docker-compose.yml` file.  
- It allows developers to split application code into **multiple independently running services**, making it easier to manage microservices-based applications.  
- Each service runs in its own container and can be scaled independently.  


The wording **"split the app code into numerous independently running services"** comes from Visual Studio code documentation not the docker documentation. It is inappropriate for DCA exam.  
Below is from that documentation (https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/containers/docker-compose)
"Docker Compose provides a way to orchestrate multiple containers that work together. Examples include a service that processes requests and a front-end web site, or a service that uses a supporting function such as a Redis cache. If you are using the microservices model for your app development, you can use Docker Compose to factor the app code into several independently running services that communicate using web requests."

## 🔍 Why the Question Is Problematic

### ❗ Original Question:
> **133. Which of the following is used to split the app code into numerous independently running services?**  
> A. Docker Compose  
> B. Docker Stack  
> C. Docker Swarm  
> D. None of the Above

## 🧠 Analysis of Each Option (as DOMC: True/False + Reason)

### **A. Docker Compose — ✅ True**
- **True**, because Docker Compose defines and runs multi-container applications, allowing each container (representing a service) to run independently.
- Especially in **development environments**, it is often used to architect microservices-like structures via YAML config.

---

### **B. Docker Stack — ✅ True (also!)**
- **Also true**, depending on context.
- Docker Stack **extends Docker Compose for production**, deploying services to a Swarm cluster.
- It also splits services defined in a Compose file and runs them as individual services on Swarm nodes.
- **So Stack does the same thing, just in a more production-ready and distributed environment.**

> ✅ **Both A and B** can be valid, depending on what the exam is testing — development vs. production orchestration.

---

### **C. Docker Swarm — ⚠️ Partially True / Often Considered Indirect**
- **Not directly** responsible for "splitting code" into services.
- Instead, Swarm is the **orchestrator** that runs services deployed via Stack or other tools.
- It's more accurate to say Swarm **manages** those services rather than creates or splits them.
- So arguably: **False**, if strictly asking about the splitting responsibility.

---

### **D. None of the Above — ❌ False**
- As at least one (A and B) are correct.

## 🛠️ Better Question Wording for Exams

If the goal was to **test Compose**, the question should emphasize development or local environment orchestration:

> **"Which tool is primarily used to define and manage multi-container Docker applications in a development environment?"**  
> ✅ Intended Answer: **Docker Compose**

Or, if testing **Stack**:

> **"Which tool deploys a multi-service application defined in a Compose file into a Docker Swarm cluster?"**  
> ✅ Intended Answer: **Docker Stack**

---

## ✅ Conclusion

- This question **as written** is **ambiguous**, because both Compose and Stack fit, depending on scope (dev vs. prod).
- It uses terminology ("split app code") that **originates from Visual Studio docs**, **not** core Docker docs.
- Therefore, it’s **inappropriate** for a cert exam like DCA where precision is essential.
