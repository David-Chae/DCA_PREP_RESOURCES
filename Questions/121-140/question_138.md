## ❌ Why the Question Is Problematic

### 🔸 1. **“How many steps are required to use Compose?”** is **too open-ended.**
- The **number of steps** depends on:
  - **Granularity** of explanation.
  - **Context** of usage (development vs production).
  - **Which documentation** or teaching resource is being referenced.

### 🔸 2. **Docker's documentation** may present **3 or 4 steps**, but this is just a structure for **instruction**, not a **technical requirement**.
- For example, Docker’s official docs might say:
  1. Define `docker-compose.yml`
  2. Run `docker-compose up`
  3. Optional: Run `docker-compose down`

> Are those 2 steps? 3? Some docs break them into 4 or 5 including building images, configuring volumes, etc.

## 🔎 Summary

- A question like **"How many steps are required to use Compose?"** is **ill-suited** for exams.
- It **tests memorization** of a specific documentation structure, not real-world Docker skills.
- You were spot-on — a better test of understanding would focus on **functional knowledge**, not arbitrary step counts.

Would you like help turning this into a question bank that's exam-appropriate and fair?
