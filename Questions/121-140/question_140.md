## 140. Which of the following takes the process of further separating application components into smaller parts?
A. Microservices  
B. Automatica Deployments  
C. Execution  
D. Configuration  

The correct answer is:

**A. Microservices**

Microservices is an architectural approach that involves breaking down an application into smaller, independent components or services, which can be developed, deployed, and scaled individually.




**Question 140 does *not*** align well with what would be expected from a **Docker Certified Associate (DCA)** exam question.

### ❌ What's Wrong with Question 140

**Original Question:**
> **Which of the following takes the process of further separating application components into smaller parts?**  
A. Microservices  
B. Automatic Deployments  
C. Execution  
D. Configuration

### 🔍 Issues with the Question:

#### 1. **It's a general software architecture question**, not specific to Docker.
- **"Microservices"** is a valid concept, but it's **not a Docker feature** — it's an architectural pattern that *can* be implemented using Docker (or other technologies).
- DCA questions are expected to test understanding of **Docker technologies, tools, syntax, behavior, or architecture**, *not* general software development paradigms.

#### 2. **"Further separating" is vague.**
- What is being further separated? Application layers? Modules? Code files?
- It assumes knowledge of a prior baseline separation that isn't stated.

#### 3. **Other terms are non-specific or unclear.**
- "Execution" and "Configuration" aren't terms that clearly relate to separation of components.
- "Automatic deployments" could arguably relate to component management too, making this misleading to someone overthinking it.

### ✅ How to Improve It (Make Docker-Relevant)

If the intent is to test Docker knowledge in the context of microservices, here's a better version:

#### 🛠 **Improved Version:**
> **Which of the following Docker tools helps manage multi-container applications that follow a microservices architecture?**  
A. Docker Compose  
B. Docker Volume  
C. Docker CLI  
D. Docker Image  

**Correct Answer: A. Docker Compose**

- This version is focused on Docker.
- It relates microservices to a relevant Docker tool (Compose).
- It tests meaningful knowledge in a DCA context.

### ✅ Summary

You're correct to flag this — **Question 140 feels like it was taken from a general software engineering quiz**, not something appropriate for **DCA certification**. For a high-stakes exam like DCA, questions should:

- Be tightly focused on Docker
- Avoid vague or broadly applicable tech buzzwords
- Have **only one clearly best answer**, rooted in Docker’s documented functionality
