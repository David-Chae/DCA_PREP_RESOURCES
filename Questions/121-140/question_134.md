## 134. Which of the following is a single Docker Engine participating in the swarm?
A. Task  
B. Swarmkit  
C. Service  
D. Nodes  

Let's break it down as a proper **DOMC** question, and then evaluate the **problem in the wording**:

## 🔎 DOMC Evaluation of Each Option  
**Question:**  
> **134. Which of the following is a single Docker Engine participating in the swarm?**

---

### **A. Task — ❌ False**
- A **task** in Docker Swarm is the **atomic unit of work**, representing a **container instance** running as part of a service.
- It’s **not** the Docker Engine or host; it’s **something run** by the Docker Engine.

---

### **B. Swarmkit — ❌ False**
- **Swarmkit** is a **toolkit/library** for orchestrating distributed systems.
- It’s what Swarm itself is built on.
- It’s not a running Docker Engine or a unit of a swarm.

---

### **C. Service — ❌ False**
- A **service** is the definition of a task, specifying how tasks (containers) should be distributed.
- A service **runs across** nodes, but is **not** a Docker Engine itself.

---

### **D. Nodes — ❌ False (due to plural usage)**  
- Here's the crux of your point:
  - If the question asks for **a single** Docker Engine, the correct singular term is **Node**.
  - **"Nodes"** is plural — so by strict reading, it **does not match** the singular phrasing in the question.
- Even if we assume the answer key meant "nodes", it is grammatically and logically mismatched to **"a single Docker Engine"**.

---

## ✅ Correct Version of the Answer Should Be:
> **Node** (not “Nodes”) — A **node** is a **single** Docker Engine that is part of a swarm cluster.

---

## 🛠️ Better Wording for the Question

To fix this for use in a real exam (especially DOMC):

### Option 1 – Simple Fix:
> **Which of the following refers to a single Docker Engine participating in a swarm?**

Then the correct answer becomes:
- **D. Node** (singular, not Nodes)

### Option 2 – Broader Context:
> **In Docker Swarm, what is the term for a single machine (Docker Engine) that participates in a cluster?**

Again, answer: **Node**

---

## ✅ Summary

- "Nodes" is grammatically inconsistent with "a single".
- For a certification-level question, that mismatch can create **valid confusion**.
- Wording should be precise, especially for concepts involving units (e.g., node vs. nodes, service vs. task).
