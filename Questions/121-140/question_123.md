## 123. Which of the following configuration files is used for testing purposes?
A. loop-lvm  
B. direct-lvm  
C. Both A and B  
D. None of the Above  

The correct answer is:  

**A. loop-lvm**  

- **loop-lvm** is used for testing purposes in Dockerâ€™s **devicemapper** storage driver. It utilizes loopback devices, which are not recommended for production due to performance and reliability concerns.  
- **direct-lvm**, on the other hand, is the preferred method for production environments as it directly uses block devices.
