## 132. Which of the following runs on a Docker Swarm?
A. Swarm  
B. Stack  
C. Compose  
D. Inspect  

The correct answer is:  

**B. Stack**  

- **Stack** is used to define and deploy multi-service applications in Docker Swarm.  
- A stack is a collection of services that are deployed together, often through a `docker-compose.yml` file, but managed by Docker Swarm.  
- **Swarm** refers to the cluster of Docker nodes, **Compose** is used for single-node or non-Swarm configurations, and **Inspect** is a command to get details about Docker objects like containers or images.
