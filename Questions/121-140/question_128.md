## 128. In which storage option does the object ID reference the stored data?
A. File System Storage  
B. Block Storage  
C. Object Storage  
D. None of the Above  

The correct answer is:  

**C. Object Storage**  

- In **Object Storage**, data is stored as objects, and each object is assigned a unique **object ID**.  
- This ID is used to reference and retrieve the data, rather than using traditional file paths or block addresses.  
- Object storage is commonly used in **cloud environments** (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).



Great ‚Äî this is a **DOMC-style** multiple choice question. Let's go through each option one-by-one, marking **True** or **False**, with reasoning.

### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer: C. Object Storage**

In **object storage**, data is stored as objects, and each object is identified using a **unique object ID (or key)**. This ID references the object directly.

### üß† DOMC Breakdown (True/False with Reason):

---

#### **A. File System Storage** ‚Äî ‚ùå **False**  
- File system storage uses a **hierarchical structure** of files and directories.
- Data is accessed via **paths** and **filenames**, not object IDs.
- So it does **not** use object IDs to reference data.

---

#### **B. Block Storage** ‚Äî ‚ùå **False**  
- Block storage breaks data into **fixed-size blocks** and stores them without metadata or hierarchy.
- The system (like a filesystem or database) manages how those blocks are reassembled.
- It does **not** use object IDs either.

---

#### **C. Object Storage** ‚Äî ‚úÖ **True**  
- Each object is stored with its own **unique identifier** (like a hash or UUID).
- The object ID is what you use to **retrieve or reference** the data.
- This is the storage type the question is directly referring to.

---

#### **D. None of the Above** ‚Äî ‚ùå **False**  
- Since **C. Object Storage** is true, this catch-all answer is **false**.

---

### ‚úÖ Final Answer:
- A ‚Äì False  
- B ‚Äì False  
- **C ‚Äì True**  
- D ‚Äì False

Let me know if you want to reframe this into a cleaner or more DOMC-compatible format too.
