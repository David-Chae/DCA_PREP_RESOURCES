## 128. In which storage option does the object ID reference the stored data?
A. File System Storage  
B. Block Storage  
C. Object Storage  
D. None of the Above  

The correct answer is:  

**C. Object Storage**  

- In **Object Storage**, data is stored as objects, and each object is assigned a unique **object ID**.  
- This ID is used to reference and retrieve the data, rather than using traditional file paths or block addresses.  
- Object storage is commonly used in **cloud environments** (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).
