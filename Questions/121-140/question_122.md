## 122. Which of the following are two alternatives for containers to store files?
A. npipe Mount  
B. Volume Mount  
C. Bind Mount  
D. tmps Mount  

The correct answers are:  

**B. Volume Mount**  
**C. Bind Mount**  

- **Volume Mount**: Managed by Docker, volumes are stored outside the container's filesystem and persist even if the container is removed.  
- **Bind Mount**: Maps a directory or file from the host machine into the container, allowing direct access to the host filesystem.
