## 130. Which of the following allows users to manage containers deployed across hosts?
```sh
A. Docker Swarm
B. Docker Stack
C. Docker Volume
D. None of the above
```

The correct answer is:  

**A. Docker Swarm**  

### Explanation:  
**Docker Swarm** is a container orchestration tool that allows users to manage and deploy containers across multiple Docker hosts. It provides features like clustering, service discovery, load balancing, and scaling for containers deployed across a cluster of machines.

### Why not the others?  
- **B. Docker Stack**: Docker Stack is used to deploy a group of services (containers) as a unit in Docker Swarm, but it does not manage containers across hosts directly. It is a way to define multi-container applications in Swarm.
- **C. Docker Volume**: Docker Volumes are used for persistent storage management and are not related to container orchestration or management across hosts.
- **D. None of the above**: Since **Docker Swarm** is the correct answer, this option is not applicable.
