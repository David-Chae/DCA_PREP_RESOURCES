## How would we go about keeping track of changes made to an image in source control (i.e., git)?
```
1.Maintain tags for each new version within the Docker registry.
2. We would store the Dockerfile in source control.
3. We would push the image layers to a source control repository.
4. We would use Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) to handle this.
```

‚úÖ **Correct answer:**  
**We would store the Dockerfile in source control.**

---

### ‚úÖ Explanation:

The **Dockerfile** is a text file that defines how to build a Docker image. By storing it (and any supporting files like scripts or configuration files) in a version control system like **Git**, you can:

- Track changes over time  
- Reproduce builds reliably  
- Collaborate with team members  
- Roll back to previous versions

### ‚ùå Why the other options are incorrect:

- **"Maintain tags for each new version within the Docker registry"**  
  üî∏ Tags help manage versions **within the registry**, but they‚Äôre not connected to **source control** and don‚Äôt track how the image was built.

- **"We would push the image layers to a source control repository"**  
  ‚ùå Docker image layers are binary data and not suitable for Git. Git is meant for **text-based source code** and not large binary blobs.

- **"We would use Docker Trusted Registry (DTR) to handle this."**  
  üî∏ DTR helps with secure image distribution and scanning, but it‚Äôs not a **source control system**.
