## Where can we find a repository URL for installing the Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)?

To find the **repository URL for installing Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)**, you must go through **Docker‚Äôs official enterprise partner portal or subscription service**, as **Docker EE is a commercial product** and not openly available like Docker CE (Community Edition).

---

### ‚úÖ Here‚Äôs how to get the Docker EE repository URL:

#### 1. **Visit Docker‚Äôs official enterprise portal:**
- Go to: [https://www.mirantis.com/software/docker/docker-enterprise/](https://www.mirantis.com/software/docker/docker-enterprise/)
  > Mirantis now maintains Docker EE after acquiring Docker Enterprise in 2019.

#### 2. **Sign in or request a trial:**
- You'll need a **Mirantis (Docker Enterprise) subscription** to access the repositories.
- After logging in, you'll be given **custom repository URLs** for your operating system and version.

#### 3. **The repository URL is usually in this form:**
```
https://<customer_id>.docker.com/repo/ubuntu/ or /rhel/ or /centos/
```
Or:
```
https://packages.mirantis.com/<os-version>/
```

You‚Äôll also receive credentials (username and password or token) to access private repositories.

### üõë Important Notes:
- Docker EE is not available via public package managers like `apt` or `yum` without this subscription.
- The repositories contain packages like `docker-ee`, `docker-ee-cli`, and `docker-ee-engine`.

---

### üê≥ If You Just Need Docker CE (Community Edition):
Use the official public repo:
```bash
https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu
```
Or:
```bash
https://download.docker.com/linux/centos
```

## SAMPLE QUESTION : Where can we find a repository URL for installing the Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)?
```
1. Docker Trusted Registry
2. Docker Marketplace
3. Docker Hub
4. Docker Enterprise Hub
```

The correct answer is:

> ‚úÖ **4. Docker Enterprise Hub**

---

### üîç Explanation:

Let‚Äôs break down each option:

#### 1. **Docker Trusted Registry**
- ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  This is a **private image registry** used to **store and manage container images securely**, but **not for installing Docker EE** itself.

#### 2. **Docker Marketplace**
- ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  Docker Marketplace is for **browsing and acquiring containerized apps**, not the Docker EE installation packages or repository URLs.

#### 3. **Docker Hub**
- ‚ùå Incorrect.  
  Docker Hub is the **default public registry** for Docker images (mostly open source/CE). It does **not host Docker EE packages**.

#### 4. **Docker Enterprise Hub**
- ‚úÖ **Correct.**  
  The **Docker Enterprise Hub** is the portal where **Docker EE customers** can:
  - Log in with their credentials
  - Access installation instructions
  - Retrieve **repository URLs** for their OS (RHEL, CentOS, Ubuntu, etc.)
  - Manage subscriptions and support

After Docker Enterprise was acquired by Mirantis, this may also be part of the **Mirantis Launchpad / Customer Portal**, but the **Docker Enterprise Hub** remains the correct terminology for this context.
