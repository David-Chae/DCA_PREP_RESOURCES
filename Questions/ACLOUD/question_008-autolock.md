## Sally wants to prevent Docker Swarm encryption keys from being stored insecurely on her swarm managers. How can she tackle enforcing a lock on the swarm cluster?

To prevent Docker Swarm encryption keys from being stored insecurely on the swarm managers, **Sally** can implement **encryption at rest** for the swarm secrets and configure **key management** to ensure that the sensitive data is protected.

### üõ°Ô∏è Steps Sally can take:

#### 1. **Enable Swarm Encryption at Rest**
- Docker Swarm provides an option to **encrypt secrets at rest** using the `--autolock` flag when initializing or updating the Swarm. This ensures that the encryption keys used for the swarm secrets are not stored in plaintext on the manager nodes, making it harder for unauthorized users to access them.

- When `--autolock` is enabled, Docker uses a **password** (or **recovery key**) to **unlock** the swarm during startup. Without the correct password, the swarm cannot be started, preventing unauthorized access to the encryption keys.

#### 2. **Enable `--autolock` When Initializing the Swarm:**

When initializing the Docker Swarm on the first manager node, Sally can enable autolock using:

```bash
docker swarm init --autolock
```

This will prompt for a **recovery key** during the setup. Sally should securely store this key, as it will be required whenever the manager nodes are restarted or if they experience failures.

#### 3. **Configure Autolock for Existing Swarm:**

If Sally already has a Swarm cluster running and wants to enable encryption at rest (autolock) on the existing cluster, she can update the cluster with:

```bash
docker swarm update --autolock=true
```

This will enable autolock on the Swarm. After this change, whenever the manager nodes are restarted, they will need the recovery key to unlock the swarm.

#### 4. **Storing and Managing the Recovery Key:**
- The recovery key is the only way to unlock the Swarm when it is restarted after a failure or restart. Sally should **store this key securely**, such as in a **hardware security module (HSM)** or **secure vault** (like **HashiCorp Vault** or **AWS Secrets Manager**).
  
- **Note**: If the recovery key is lost or compromised, Sally won‚Äôt be able to recover the swarm, and any previously encrypted secrets will be inaccessible.

### üí° Summary of Actions:

1. Use the `--autolock` flag during swarm initialization or update the swarm after setup to enable encryption at rest.
2. Securely store the recovery key used to unlock the Swarm.
3. This prevents Docker from storing swarm encryption keys in plaintext on the manager nodes, making it harder for unauthorized parties to access the sensitive data.

## SAMPLE QUESTION : Sally wants to prevent Docker Swarm encryption keys from being stored insecurely on her swarm managers. How can she tackle enforcing a lock on the swarm cluster?
```
1. Sally can locate the critical files after the installation and delete them.
2. Sally can use the --autolock=true flag with the docker swarm update command.
3. The autolock feature must be turned on when the cluster is initialized and cannot be enabled after the fact.
4. Sally cannot do this because Docker does not offer this functionality.
```

The correct answer is:

> ‚úÖ **Sally can use the --autolock=true flag with the docker swarm update command.**

---

### Explanation of Each Option:

#### ‚úÖ **"Sally can use the --autolock=true flag with the docker swarm update command."**
- **Correct.**
- Sally can enable the **autolock feature** on an existing Docker Swarm cluster by using the following command:
  ```bash
  docker swarm update --autolock=true
  ```
  This will enable the feature, which ensures that the **encryption keys** used for Swarm secrets are stored securely and **cannot be accessed without the recovery key**. The recovery key is required to unlock the swarm if the manager nodes are restarted.

#### ‚ùå **"The autolock feature must be turned on when the cluster is initialized and cannot be enabled after the fact."**
- **Incorrect.**
- The **autolock feature** can **indeed be enabled after the cluster is initialized** using the `docker swarm update --autolock=true` command. It is not limited to the initialization phase.

#### ‚ùå **"Sally cannot do this because Docker does not offer this functionality."**
- **Incorrect.**
- Docker **does offer** the ability to enable autolock via the `--autolock` flag. This feature ensures encryption keys are securely handled by requiring a recovery key to unlock the Swarm.

#### ‚ùå **"Sally can locate the critical files after the installation and delete them."**
- **Incorrect.**
- Deleting critical files after installation is **not a recommended or secure method** for handling encryption keys in Docker Swarm. The proper approach is to use **autolock** to ensure keys are stored securely and can only be accessed with the recovery key.

---

### üßë‚Äçüíª Final Summary:
To prevent Docker Swarm encryption keys from being stored insecurely, Sally should use the `--autolock=true` flag to enable **autolock** on the swarm, ensuring that encryption keys are protected by a recovery key and cannot be accessed easily.
