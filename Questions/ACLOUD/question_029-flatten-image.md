How can we flatten an existing multi-layered image into a single layer?
```
1. We can use the --flatten flag with the docker build command.
2. We can use a multi-stage build.
3. We can run a container from the image, export it, and then import it as a new image.
4. We would not include any RUN directives in our Dockerfile.
```

The correct answer is: **We can run a container from the image, export it, and then import it as a new image.**

### Explanation:

#### **Flattening an image into a single layer:**
One way to "flatten" a multi-layered Docker image (where each layer corresponds to an instruction like `RUN`, `COPY`, `ADD`, etc.) is by exporting the image to a tarball, then importing it back as a new image. This approach combines all layers into a single one.

The steps would be:

1. **Run a container from the image:**
   ```bash
   docker run --name temp-container <image-name>
   ```

2. **Export the container's filesystem:**
   ```bash
   docker export temp-container > container.tar
   ```

3. **Import the exported filesystem as a new image:**
   ```bash
   docker import container.tar <new-image-name>
   ```

This new image will consist of a single layer, as it combines all the changes from the previous image layers into one.

#### Why the other options are incorrect:

- **We can use the --flatten flag with the docker build command**:  
  This is incorrect. There is **no `--flatten` flag** for the `docker build` command. Flattening images requires other methods (like the one above).

- **We can use a multi-stage build**:  
  Multi-stage builds are used for optimizing Docker images by copying only the necessary artifacts between stages. While multi-stage builds can help reduce the size and improve the efficiency of your image, they don't "flatten" an image into a single layer. Instead, they remove unnecessary files or dependencies.

- **We would not include any RUN directives in our Dockerfile**:  
  Not including `RUN` directives doesn't flatten an image. It just prevents additional layers from being added. You could still have multiple layers even if you don't use `RUN` commands, depending on the other instructions like `COPY`, `ADD`, etc.

### Summary:
To flatten an image into a single layer, you would run a container from the image, export it, and then import it as a new image.
