## Which storage driver is the default for CentOS 7 and earlier?
```

- **Overlay2** is the default storage driver on newer Linux distributions and Docker versions, but it is not the default for CentOS 7 and earlier.

- **aufs** is another storage driver that Docker has used in the past, but it's not the default on CentOS 7.

- **loop-lvm** is not a common default storage driver in CentOS.

### Summary:
