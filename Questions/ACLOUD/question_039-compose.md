## What tool should we use if we need to manage a multi-container application as a unit on a single Docker host?
```
1. We should use a Docker stack.
2. We should use Docker Compose.
3. We should execute docker-run.
4. We should use Docker Swarm.
```

Here's the evaluation of each option:

---

### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer: We should use Docker Compose.**  
**‚úîÔ∏è True**  
- **Docker Compose** is specifically designed to manage **multi-container applications** on a **single Docker host**.
- You define the services, networks, and volumes in a `docker-compose.yml` file and run them together as a unit using `docker-compose up`.

---

### üî∂ **We should use a Docker stack.**  
**‚ùå False** (for single-host scenarios)  
- Docker **stack** is meant for **multi-node orchestration** using **Docker Swarm mode**.
- While it supports Compose files, it's used with `docker swarm` and not ideal for single-host environments.

---

### ‚ùå **We should execute docker-run.**  
**False**  
- `docker run` is used to run **individual containers**, not suited for managing **multi-container applications as a unit**.

---

### ‚ùå **We should use Docker Swarm.**  
**False**  
- Docker Swarm is a **clustering and orchestration tool** for managing **distributed applications** across **multiple hosts**, not specifically for managing container groups on a **single host**.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary Table:

| Option                         | Correct? | Reason |
|-------------------------------|----------|--------|
| Docker Compose                | ‚úîÔ∏è True  | Best for multi-container apps on a single host. |
| Docker stack                  | ‚ùå False | Intended for multi-node swarm setups. |
| docker-run                    | ‚ùå False | For single containers only. |
| Docker Swarm                  | ‚ùå False | For clustering across multiple hosts. |

Let me know if you‚Äôd like a sample `docker-compose.yml` to see how it works in action!
