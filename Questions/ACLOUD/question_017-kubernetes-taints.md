## Which Kubernetes Node taint effects would evict existing Pods that do not tolerate the taint bearing that effect?

In Kubernetes, the **taint effects** that **evict existing pods** (if those pods do not tolerate the taint) are:

---

### ✅ `NoExecute`

- 🔥 **This is the only effect that can evict existing pods.**
- ❌ If a pod **does not tolerate** a `NoExecute` taint, it will be **evicted immediately** or after a **grace period** if a `tolerationSeconds` is specified.
- ✅ Pods that do tolerate it (with `NoExecute`) will either stay or delay eviction based on the toleration settings.

#### Example:
```yaml
taints:
- key: "example.com/special"
  effect: "NoExecute"
```

---

### 🚫 `NoSchedule`
- Prevents **new pods** from being scheduled unless they tolerate the taint.
- ❌ **Does not evict** existing pods.

---

### 🚫 `PreferNoSchedule`
- Tries to avoid placing new pods on the node.
- It's a **"soft" version** of `NoSchedule`.
- ❌ **Does not evict** existing pods.

### ✅ Summary

| Effect           | Prevents New Pods | Evicts Existing Pods |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| `NoExecute`      | ✅                | ✅                   |
| `NoSchedule`     | ✅                | ❌                   |
| `PreferNoSchedule` | ⚠️ (soft)        | ❌                   |
