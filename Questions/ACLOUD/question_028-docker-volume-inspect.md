Which of the following commands would we use to locate the data for a volume on the host?
```
docker volume navigate <volume>
docker volume logs <volume>
docker volume locate <volume>
docker volume inspect <volume>
```
The correct answer is **`docker volume inspect <volume>`**.

### Explanation:
- **`docker volume inspect <volume>`**: This command provides detailed information about the specified volume, including the location of the volume on the host system. It will give you a JSON output that includes the "Mountpoint," which is the location of the volume on the host filesystem.

### Why the other commands are incorrect:
- **`docker volume navigate <volume>`**: This is not a valid Docker command.
- **`docker volume logs <volume>`**: This command does not exist in Docker and is not used for volume inspection.
- **`docker volume locate <volume>`**: This is not a valid Docker command either.

### Example of using `docker volume inspect`:
```bash
docker volume inspect <volume_name>
```

This will output a JSON structure where you can find the **"Mountpoint"** key, which shows the path to the volume's data on the host filesystem.

### Summary:
To locate the data for a Docker volume on the host, you would use the command **`docker volume inspect <volume>`**.
