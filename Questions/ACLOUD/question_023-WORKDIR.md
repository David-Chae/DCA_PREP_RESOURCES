Which of the following statements does not apply to the WORKDIR directive?
```
It sets the working directory for the container at runtime.
It affects only the build and does not impact containers that run from the image.
It can use both absolute and relative paths.
It sets the working directory for subsequent build steps.
```

Let's evaluate each statement regarding the `WORKDIR` directive in a Dockerfile:

### 1. **It sets the working directory for the container at runtime.**

**False**  
The `WORKDIR` directive does **not** set the working directory for the container at runtime directly. It is used to set the working directory during the build process. While it does set the working directory for subsequent steps in the Dockerfile (including running the container), it does not directly affect the runtime behavior of the container. However, you can also change the working directory for the container at runtime by using the `docker run` command with the `-w` option.

### 2. **It affects only the build and does not impact containers that run from the image.**

**True**  
This is the statement that does **not** apply to the `WORKDIR` directive. The `WORKDIR` directive **does** affect the container when it is run. It sets the working directory inside the container for any commands that are executed in the container (such as those specified in the `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, or any script the container runs). It is also used during the build process, but it does influence the container's runtime behavior, so this statement is incorrect in context.

### 3. **It can use both absolute and relative paths.**

**True**  
The `WORKDIR` directive can accept both **absolute** and **relative paths**. If a relative path is provided, it is evaluated relative to the current working directory.

### 4. **It sets the working directory for subsequent build steps.**

**True**  
The `WORKDIR` directive sets the working directory for all subsequent build steps (like `RUN`, `CMD`, `ENTRYPOINT`, etc.) in the Dockerfile. It ensures that commands are executed from the specified directory during the build.

### Summary:
- The correct answer is: **"It affects only the build and does not impact containers that run from the image."**  
  This statement does not apply to the `WORKDIR` directive. It **does** impact the container at runtime, setting the working directory for commands executed within the container.
