## Which of the following namespaces is not enabled by default?
```
1. uts
2. user
3. pid
4. mnt
```

The correct answer is **`user`**.

### Explanation:

In Kubernetes, **namespaces** are used to isolate and manage resources within a container. Different namespaces are enabled by default depending on the environment and container configuration.

- **`uts` (UTS namespace)**: This namespace allows containers to have their own hostname and domain name. It is **enabled by default** in most container runtimes.

- **`user` (User namespace)**: This namespace provides user and group ID mappings to isolate users in a container from users on the host system. It is **not enabled by default** and needs to be explicitly enabled. The use of user namespaces improves security by ensuring that a process in a container is not running with root privileges on the host.

- **`pid` (PID namespace)**: This namespace provides process isolation, where containers can have their own process ID space, separate from the host. It is **enabled by default** in most container runtimes.

- **`mnt` (Mount namespace)**: This namespace allows containers to have their own file system mounts, which is essential for managing file systems and volumes in containers. It is **enabled by default** in most container runtimes.

### Summary:
**`user`** namespace is not enabled by default, unlike `uts`, `pid`, and `mnt` namespaces.
