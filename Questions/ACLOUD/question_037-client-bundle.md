## What is an easy way to configure a client to communicate with Universal Control Plane (UCP) using client certificates?

Let's evaluate each option **true or false** with **reasons**, in the context of configuring a client to communicate with **Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP)** using **client certificates**:

---

### ✅ **1. We can log into UCP via a browser.**  
**❌ False**  
- While logging into UCP via a browser is possible, it is **not related to configuring a Docker client using client certificates**.
- This method is for interacting with the **UCP web UI**, not for setting up CLI access with certificates.

---

### ✅ **2. We can download and use a client bundle.**  
**✔️ True**  
- This is the **correct and recommended way** to configure a Docker CLI client to securely connect to UCP.
- The **client bundle** contains:
  - TLS client certificates
  - Docker client configuration (`env.sh` / `docker.env`)
- It can be downloaded from the UCP web interface or via the API.

---

### ✅ **3. docker ucp login**  
**❌ False**  
- There is **no `docker ucp login`** command in the Docker CLI.
- This is an invalid command and not a recognized way to set up client certificates for UCP.

---

### ✅ **4. We can execute the docker login command.**  
**❌ False**  
- `docker login` is used to authenticate with a **Docker registry** (like Docker Hub or DTR), **not UCP**.
- It does not set up TLS client certificates or configure the client to connect securely to a UCP cluster.

---

### ✅ Final Answer:

| Option | Answer | Reason |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 1      | ❌ False | Web UI access is not the same as CLI certificate configuration. |
| 2      | ✔️ True  | Correct method—download client bundle with certs and Docker context. |
| 3      | ❌ False | Invalid/nonexistent command. |
| 4      | ❌ False | Used for registry login, not UCP TLS setup. |
