## 248. How to create a volume with the volume driver?
A. To create a volume with a volume driver, you can use the docker volume create command with the --driver flag, specifying the desired driver. For example, docker volume create --driver vieux/sshfs -o sshcmd=test@node2:/home/test -o password=test-password sshvolume  
B. You can create a volume with a volume driver by using the docker create volume command and specifying the driver and driver-specific options  
C. Docker volumes cannot be created with volume drivers; they are limited to the default drivers provided by Docker  
D. Volume drivers are only used for swarm services and cannot be applied to named volumes  

The correct answer is:

**A. To create a volume with a volume driver, you can use the docker volume create command with the --driver flag, specifying the desired driver. For example, docker volume create --driver vieux/sshfs -o sshcmd=test@node2:/home/test -o password=test-password sshvolume**

### Explanation:
- **A** is the correct answer because the `docker volume create` command can indeed be used with the `--driver` flag to specify a custom volume driver and its options. The example provided (`vieux/sshfs`) is a third-party volume driver that mounts a remote file system using SSH.
  
- **B** is incorrect because the command should be `docker volume create`, not `docker create volume`, and it also requires the `--driver` flag to specify a driver.

- **C** is incorrect because Docker supports custom volume drivers, and they are not limited to the default drivers. Docker allows third-party drivers as well.

- **D** is incorrect because volume drivers can be used in both standalone containers and Docker Swarm services, not just for Swarm services.

Thus, **A** is the correct choice.
