## 241. How to find which networks the service is connected to?
A. To find out which networks the service is connected to, you can use docker network inspect my-network. Alternatively, you can use docker service ls to find the service name and then docker service ps <SERVICE> to list the networks it is connected to.  
B. You can determine the service's connected networks by using the docker network list <SERVICE>  
C. Finding the networks a service is connected to is not possible through Docker commands  
D. Use docker service network <SERVICE> to list the networks to which a service is connected.  

The correct answer is:

**A. To find out which networks the service is connected to, you can use docker network inspect my-network. Alternatively, you can use docker service ls to find the service name and then docker service ps <SERVICE> to list the networks it is connected to.**

### Explanation:
- **A** is correct because you can inspect the networks a service is connected to in two ways: 
  - Use `docker network inspect <network-name>` to inspect the details of the network, which will show the containers (services) connected to it.
  - Alternatively, you can use `docker service ps <SERVICE>` to see the tasks running for the service, which will include information about the networks that the service containers are connected to.

- **B** is incorrect because `docker network list <SERVICE>` is not a valid command in Docker.

- **C** is incorrect because it is indeed possible to find the networks a service is connected to, and there are several commands for this.

- **D** is incorrect because `docker service network <SERVICE>` is not a valid command in Docker either.

Thus, **A** is the correct answer.
