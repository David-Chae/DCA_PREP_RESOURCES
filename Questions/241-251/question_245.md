## 245.How to create a service with volume?
A. To create a service with a volume, use the docker service create command with the --mount source=myvol2,target=/app option, specifying the source volume and the target path in the service. For example, docker service create -d --replicas=4 --name devtest-service --mount source=myvol2,target=/app nginx:latest  
B. Services cannot be created with volumes; only standalone containers support volumes  
C. To create a service with a volume, use the docker service create -d --replicas=4 --name devtest-service -v myvol2:/app nginx:latest command  
D. Volumes are not supported in Docker services; only bind mounts can be used  

The correct answer is:

**A. To create a service with a volume, use the docker service create command with the --mount source=myvol2,target=/app option, specifying the source volume and the target path in the service. For example, docker service create -d --replicas=4 --name devtest-service --mount source=myvol2,target=/app nginx:latest**

### Explanation:
- **A** is correct because it uses the correct syntax for creating a Docker service with a volume using the `--mount` flag. The `--mount` option is the preferred way to create and manage volumes in Docker services, providing an explicit way to define the source and target of the volume mount.

- **B** is incorrect because Docker services do support volumes; you just need to use the appropriate syntax (like `--mount`) to define volumes when creating the service.

- **C** is incorrect because the `-v` flag is typically used for standalone containers and not for Docker services in the case of volumes. The `--mount` flag is the preferred and more flexible way for services.

- **D** is incorrect because Docker services do support volumes, and the `--mount` flag can be used for both named volumes and bind mounts.

Thus, **A** is the correct answer.
