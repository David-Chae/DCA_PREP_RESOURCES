## 62. What is the term for a package containing all the software needed to run a Docker container?
```sh
A. Image
B. Package
C. Repository
D. Kernel
```

The correct answer is:  

**A. Image**  

### Explanation:  
A **Docker image** is a package that contains everything needed to run a Docker container, including the application code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. It is essentially the blueprint for creating containers.

### Why not the others?  
- **B. Package**: This term is too general and typically refers to software distributions or libraries, not a Docker-specific concept.  
- **C. Repository**: A **repository** is a place where Docker images are stored, not the image itself.  
- **D. Kernel**: The **kernel** is the core part of the operating system and is unrelated to Docker images, although Docker relies on the kernel for containerization.
