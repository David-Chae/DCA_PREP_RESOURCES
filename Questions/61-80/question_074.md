## 74. Which of the following network drivers is the standard for establishing connections between containers on the same host?
```sh
A. macvlan
B. Bridge
C. host
D. overlay
```

The correct answer is:  

**B. Bridge**  

### Explanation:  
The **bridge** network driver is the default and standard network driver used for establishing connections between containers on the same host. When containers are attached to a bridge network, they can communicate with each other through the bridge and are isolated from other networks unless explicitly configured to communicate with them.

### Why not the others?  
- **A. macvlan**: The `macvlan` driver is used to assign a unique MAC address to a container and allows it to appear as a physical device on the network, which is typically used for scenarios where containers need to be directly reachable on the network.
- **C. host**: The `host` driver allows containers to share the hostâ€™s network stack, but this is not the default method for connecting containers. It is typically used when you want to avoid network isolation between the container and the host.
- **D. overlay**: The `overlay` driver is used for communication between containers across multiple hosts in a Docker Swarm or other clustered environment, not for containers on the same host.
