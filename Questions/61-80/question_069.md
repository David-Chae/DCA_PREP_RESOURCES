## What does the EXPOSE directive do? 
```sh
1. It records ports meant to be published when a container is running. 
2. When you run a container, it automatically publishes ports. 
3. It allows a container's port to be accessed from the outside. 
4. It makes the container listen to a specific port.
```

The correct answer is:  

**"It records ports meant to be published when a container is running."**  

### **Explanation:**  
- The **`EXPOSE`** directive in a Dockerfile **does not** automatically publish ports or allow external access.  
- Instead, it is a **documentation feature** that **informs users** and other tools about which ports are intended to be exposed for network communication.  
- To actually **publish** the port and allow external access, you need to use the `-p` flag with `docker run`, such as:  
  ```
  docker run -p 8080:80 my-container
  ```
- The **`EXPOSE`** directive is useful when defining images because it hints at the intended network behavior but does not enforce it.  

### **Why the other options are incorrect?**
1. **"When you run a container, it automatically publishes ports."** ❌  
   - Incorrect because **`EXPOSE`** does not publish ports automatically; you must use `-p` or `--publish` when running the container.  

2. **"It allows a container's port to be accessed from the outside."** ❌  
   - Incorrect because **`EXPOSE`** only documents the intended port; external access requires explicit port publishing.  

3. **"It makes the container listen to a specific port."** ❌  
   - Incorrect because a container listens on a port only if the application inside it is configured to do so. **`EXPOSE`** does not force this behavior.  

### **Final Answer:**  
✔ **"It records ports meant to be published when a container is running."**
