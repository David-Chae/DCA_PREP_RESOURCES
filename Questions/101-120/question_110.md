## 110. Which of the following is responsible for allocating the IP address and subnet?
A. IPAM Driver  
B. Network Driver  
C.Endpoint  
D. Sandbox  

The correct answer is:

**A. IPAM Driver**

### **Explanation:**

- **IPAM (IP Address Management) Driver**: This is responsible for allocating and managing IP addresses and subnets for Docker networks. It provides IP address management services for containers, ensuring they have unique IPs within a given network.

- **Network Driver**: The network driver defines how networks are created and managed in Docker, but it doesn't specifically allocate IP addresses or subnets.

- **Endpoint**: An endpoint represents a container's connection to a network, but it does not handle IP address or subnet allocation.

- **Sandbox**: A sandbox is an isolated environment for a container or network, but it doesn't manage IP address allocation.

### **Final Answer:**
**A. IPAM Driver**
