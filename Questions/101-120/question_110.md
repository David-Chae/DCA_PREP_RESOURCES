## 110. Which of the following is responsible for allocating the IP address and subnet?
A. IPAM Driver  
B. Network Driver  
C.Endpoint  
D. Sandbox  

The correct answer is:

**A. IPAM Driver**

### **Explanation:**

Sure! Here's the DOMC (Discrete Option Multiple Choice) style evaluation of the question:

**Question 110: Which of the following is responsible for allocating the IP address and subnet?**

---

### **A. IPAM Driver**  
✅ **True**  
**Reason:** The **IPAM (IP Address Management) driver** is specifically responsible for allocating IP addresses and managing subnets in container networks. It handles the assignment of IP addresses to endpoints and ensures that each container receives the appropriate IP address within the defined network range.

---

### **B. Network Driver**  
✅ **True**  
**Reason:** The **Network Driver** is responsible for managing the overall network connectivity and configuration, including interfacing with the IPAM driver. While it doesn't *directly* allocate IPs, it works **with** the IPAM driver to ensure the container gets the right IP/subnet as part of the network setup. So, in a broader sense, it's involved in the process.

---

### **C. Endpoint**  
❌ **False**  
**Reason:** An **endpoint** represents the actual connection between a container and a network. It uses the IP address already allocated by the IPAM driver, but it does **not** allocate the address itself.

---

### **D. Sandbox**  
❌ **False**  
**Reason:** A **sandbox** is a container-specific construct that holds the network stack configuration (interfaces, routes, etc.). It **uses** the network configuration (including IP/subnet) but is not responsible for allocating them.

**A. IPAM Driver**
