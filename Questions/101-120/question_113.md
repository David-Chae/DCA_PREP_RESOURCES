## 113. Which of the following network drivers provides complete control of IP addresses?
A. ipvlan  
B. None  
C. Bridge  
D. macvlan


The correct answer is:

**A. ipvlan**

**Explanation:**

- **ipvlan** provides complete control of IP addresses within a network. It is a network driver that allows for multiple containers or virtual interfaces to share the same MAC address but have different IP addresses. This gives greater control over IP address management in a containerized environment.

The other options:

- **B. None** is not correct because **ipvlan** does indeed provide control over IP addresses.
  
- **C. Bridge** is a common network driver but does not provide as much control over IP addresses. It typically uses the host's network stack to manage IP addresses, relying more on Dockerâ€™s or the system's default network settings.
  
- **D. macvlan** creates virtual network interfaces with unique MAC addresses but does not directly control IP addresses in the way **ipvlan** does. It typically allows devices to appear on the network as if they are physical devices but does not provide the same level of IP management control as **ipvlan**.

Therefore, **ipvlan** is the correct choice as it allows for precise control over IP addresses in containerized environments.
