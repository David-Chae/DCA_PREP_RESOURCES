## 119. How many Docker storage options are there?
A. Three  
B. Four  
C. TwO  
D. Only one  

A better way to phrase the question, given the intended answer and clarification, could be:
**"How many types of Docker storage categories are there for managing container data?"**

A. Three  
B. Four  
C. Two  
D. Only one  

**Answer: A. Three**

**Explanation**:
The three types of storage options typically discussed in the context of Docker are:
1. **File system storage**: This is the default method for storing container data, usually managed by the Docker storage driver.
2. **Block storage**: Storage used for block devices (e.g., a disk partition or a virtual disk) that containers can interact with.
3. **Object storage**: This involves storage systems like cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage) for storing large amounts of unstructured data.

This more precise wording would clarify the focus on **types of storage categories** used by Docker for handling persistent container data, making it much more appropriate for an exam question.
