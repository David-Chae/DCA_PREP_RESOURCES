## 118. Which of the following commands can be used to connect the terminal?
A. docker rm  
B. docker logs  
C. docker ps  
D. docker service ls  

The correct answer is:

**B. docker logs**

### **Explanation:**
To connect to a running containerâ€™s logs and view its output, you use the **`docker logs`** command. This allows you to check the container's standard output and error logs.

### **Other options:**
- **`docker rm`**: This command removes containers, it does not connect to a terminal.
- **`docker ps`**: This command lists running containers, but does not connect to a terminal.
- **`docker service ls`**: This command lists services in a Docker Swarm, but does not connect to a terminal.

### **Final Answer:**
**B. docker logs**
