## 114. How many publishing ports are there?
A. Four  
B. Three  
C. Only one  
D. TwO  

The correct answer is:

**B. Three**

### **Explanation:**
In Docker, there are generally **three types** of port publishing methods:

1. **Host port**: A specific port on the host machine that is mapped to a port on the container.
2. **Container port**: A port inside the container that is exposed for communication with the outside world.
3. **Published port**: A port that is bound on the host machine and connected to the containerâ€™s exposed port, allowing outside access.

Thus, **three publishing ports** exist: **host port**, **container port**, and **published port**.

### **Final Answer:**
**B. Three**
