## 109. Which of the following architectures is used by Docker?
A. Elk Architecture  
B. Enterprise Architecture  
C. Container Networking Model  
D. Microservice Architecture  


The correct answer is:

**C. Container Networking Model**

### **Explanation:**

- **Container Networking Model (CNM)**: Docker uses the Container Networking Model (CNM) to define how containers can communicate with each other and with the outside world. CNM provides a framework for defining networks in Docker.

- **Elk Architecture**: The ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is used for logging and monitoring, not specifically for Docker.

- **Enterprise Architecture**: This refers to the overall structure and design of an enterpriseâ€™s IT systems, which is not directly tied to Docker.

- **Microservice Architecture**: While Docker is commonly used to deploy microservices, the architecture itself is not a Docker-specific architecture. Docker supports microservices, but it is not the model used by Docker itself.

### **Final Answer:**
**C. Container Networking Model**
