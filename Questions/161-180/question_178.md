## 178. Will downloading the docker-ee package manually result in the upgrade of Docker Engine CE to Docker Engine EE?
A. Yes
B. No

The correct answer is:

**B. No**

### Explanation:
Downloading the `docker-ee` package manually does not automatically result in an upgrade from Docker Engine Community Edition (CE) to Docker Engine Enterprise Edition (EE). While it is possible to install Docker EE by downloading the `docker-ee` package, doing so manually will not trigger an automatic upgrade.

To upgrade Docker CE to Docker EE, you need to follow a proper process:

1. **Remove Docker CE**: First, uninstall Docker CE if it is installed on your system.
2. **Add the Docker EE repository**: Ensure that your system is set up to pull Docker EE packages from the correct Docker repository.
3. **Install Docker EE**: Install the Docker EE package using the appropriate command based on your system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get` or `yum`).

The process ensures that the Docker Engine EE is properly configured and installed. Simply downloading the package manually does not guarantee a successful or complete upgrade.
