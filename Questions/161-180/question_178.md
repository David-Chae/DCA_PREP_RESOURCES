## 178. Will downloading the docker-ee package manually result in the upgrade of Docker Engine CE to Docker Engine EE?
A. Yes
B. No

The correct answer is:

**B. No**

### Explanation:
Explanation: The action described in the solution, manually downloading the 'docker-ee' package, does not upgrade Docker Engine CE (Community Edition) to Docker Engine EE (Enterprise Edition). Upgrading from Docker CE to Docker EE typically involves a more complex process, which includes obtaining a valid Docker EE subscription, applying for a valid license, and following specific upgrade procedures.
