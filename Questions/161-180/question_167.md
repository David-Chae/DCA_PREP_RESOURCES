## 167. A clusterIP service is described in the Kubernetes yaml below:

```yaml  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Service  
metadata:  
  name: dca  
spec:  
  type: clusterIP  
  selector:  
    app:nginx  
    ports:  
    - port: 8080  
      targetPort: 80  
    - port: 4443  
      targetPort: 443  
```

Is the following an accurate description of how this service routes requests:  
Requests to the service's IP address on port 8080 are forwarded to port 80 in a random pod labeled app:nginx.  
A. Yes  
B. No  

✅ **Yes, the description is accurate**, **_with one fix in the YAML formatting_**.

### 🧠 **Understanding the YAML and Description:**

The intent is for the service to forward traffic to pods matching `app: nginx` label.

Let’s break it down:

---

### 🔧 **Fix the YAML First:**

The given YAML has formatting issues — especially under the `ports` field. It should be a **list**:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dca
spec:
  type: ClusterIP
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 8080
      targetPort: 80
    - port: 4443
      targetPort: 443
```

---

### 📬 **How This Works:**

- **`type: ClusterIP`** creates an internal-only virtual IP (not accessible from outside the cluster).
- It forwards incoming requests on:
  - Port **8080** → **targetPort 80**
  - Port **4443** → **targetPort 443**
- **`selector: app: nginx`** means the traffic will be routed to any pod with that label.
- Load balancing is done **randomly (round-robin)** across all matching pods.

### ✅ **Statement Review:**

> **“Requests to the service's IP address on port 8080 are forwarded to port 80 in a random pod labeled app:nginx.”**

- ✅ Service IP on 8080 — **Correct**
- ✅ Forwarded to port 80 — **Correct**
- ✅ In a pod labeled `app: nginx` — **Correct**
- ✅ Random pod (Kubernetes load balancing) — **Correct**

---

### 🟢 **Answer: Yes**, the description is accurate **if** the YAML is properly structured.
