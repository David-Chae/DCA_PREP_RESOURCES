## 167. A clusterIP service is described in the Kubernetes yaml below:
yaml  
apiVersion: v1  
kind: Service  
metadata:  
name: dca  
spec:  
type: clusterIP  
selector:  
app:nginx  
ports:  
port: 8080  
targetPort: 80  
port: 4443  
targetPort: 443  

Is the following an accurate description of how this service routes requests:  
Requests to the service's IP address on port 8080 are forwarded to port 80 in a random pod labeled app:nginx.  
A. Yes  
B. No  

The correct answer is:

**B. No**

Explanation:
The YAML provided for the service has a configuration issue. It defines two `port` entries, which is not valid. A service can only define a single `port` field within the `ports` section.

To fix this, the `ports` section should have the following format:

```yaml
ports:
  - port: 8080
    targetPort: 80
  - port: 4443
    targetPort: 443
```

With this corrected configuration:
- Requests to the service's IP address on port 8080 would be forwarded to port 80 in a random pod labeled `app:nginx`.
- Similarly, requests on port 4443 would be forwarded to port 443 on the same pods.

So, **the description is accurate after fixing the YAML format**, but the original configuration with two `port` keys is incorrect.
