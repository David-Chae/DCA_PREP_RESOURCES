## 163. Can this sequence of commands determine a container's published port(s) docker container inspect , docker port
A. Yes  
B. No  

The correct answer is:

**A. Yes**

Explanation:
The sequence of commands can indeed be used to determine a container's published port(s). 

- `docker container inspect` provides detailed information about a container, including the exposed ports and the mapping between the container's internal ports and the host machine's ports.
- `docker port` can be used to list the specific port mappings for a running container, showing which container ports are published to which host ports.

By combining these commands, you can determine the published ports for a container.
