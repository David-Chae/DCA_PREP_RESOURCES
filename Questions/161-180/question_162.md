## 162. Assuming there are no constraints on the amount and type of external storage, are the following two criteria sufficient for Kubernetes to provision a Persistent Volume dynamically:

- A default StorageClass is supplied. 
- A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is established.
 
A. Yes  
B. No  

The correct answer is:

**A. Yes**

Explanation:
In Kubernetes, for a Persistent Volume (PV) to be provisioned dynamically, two key criteria must be met:

1. **A default StorageClass is supplied**: The StorageClass defines the type of storage that will be used (e.g., SSDs, network storage, etc.), and if no specific StorageClass is provided in the PVC, Kubernetes will use the default one.
  
2. **A PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is established**: The PVC is a request for storage. Kubernetes will use the PVC to dynamically provision a PV based on the StorageClass.

These two conditions are sufficient for Kubernetes to automatically provision a Persistent Volume dynamically, assuming there are no constraints on the amount or type of storage.
