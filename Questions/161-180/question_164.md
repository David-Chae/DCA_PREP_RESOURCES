## 164. During the development of an application to be orchestrated by Kubernetes, you want to mount the /data directory on your laptop into a container. 
## Will the following strategy accomplish this: Add a volume to the Pod that sets hostPath.path: /data Mount this volume into the Pod's containers as desired.
A. Yes
B. No

The correct answer is:

**A. Yes**

Explanation:
Using a `hostPath` volume allows you to mount a specific path from the host machine (in this case, `/data` from your laptop) into the container in a Kubernetes Pod. 

The configuration would look something like this in a Pod definition:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: data-volume
    hostPath:
      path: /data
      type: Directory

containers:
  - name: your-container
    image: your-image
    volumeMounts:
      - mountPath: /container-path
        name: data-volume
```

In this setup:
- The `hostPath` volume defines the path on the host (`/data`) and the type (usually `Directory`).
- This volume is then mounted into the container at the desired `mountPath`.

Thus, this strategy will successfully mount the `/data` directory from your laptop into the container's filesystem.
