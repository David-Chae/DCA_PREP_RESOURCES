## 177. How to remove the label from the node?
A. docker node update --label-rm foo worker 1  
B. docker node update --label-rm key=foo worker1  
C. docker node update --label-rm foo worker1 worker2  
D. docker node update -label-rm key=foo worker1 worker2  

‚úÖ **There is no correct answer: Correct command to use is docker node update --label-rm key worker1**

---

### üìò **Explanation:**

To **remove a label** from a Docker node, the correct syntax for the command is:

```bash
docker node update --label-rm key worker1
```

Where:
- `--label-rm` is used to **remove the label**.
- `key` is the label key you want to remove (`key` is the label name).
- `worker1` is the **node name** from which the label is to be removed.

### ‚ùå Why the other options are incorrect:

- **Option A:** `docker node update --label-rm foo worker 1`  
  - This could work if the label name is foo. But it seems the foo is a value by comparing other options. So this is incorrect because it doesn't properly specify the label name.

- **Option B.** `docker node update --label-rm key=foo worker1`
  - This would return key key=foo doesn't exist in node's labels message.

- **Option C:** `docker node update --label-rm foo worker1 worker2`  
  - This is incorrect because the label removal should apply to a **single key-value pair**. The command should not attempt to remove the label from multiple nodes in a single operation using this syntax.

- **Option D:** `docker node update -label-rm key=foo worker1 worker2`  
  - This option is incorrect because the flag `-label-rm` is invalid (it should be `--label-rm` with two dashes). Also, the correct syntax requires specifying the label as `key=value`.
