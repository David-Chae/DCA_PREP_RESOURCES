## 180. Will the given command from the commandline list all nodes in a swarm cluster?
## docker swarm nodes
A. Yes  
B. No  

**B. No**

Explanation:
The correct command to list all nodes in a Docker Swarm cluster is:

```
docker node ls
```

The command `docker swarm nodes` is incorrect. The `docker swarm` command is used for managing the Swarm mode itself, but `docker node ls` is the command to list the nodes in the cluster.
