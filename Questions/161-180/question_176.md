## 176. Will the given command return a list of volumes for a given container?
## docker container inspect nginx
A. Yes  
B. No  

**B. No**

Explanation:
The command `docker container inspect nginx` provides detailed information about the container named `nginx`, but it does not specifically return a list of volumes. To get a list of volumes, you would need to query Docker volumes separately using the command `docker volume ls` or inspect the container's specific mount points within the output of `docker container inspect`.
