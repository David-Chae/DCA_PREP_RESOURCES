## 237. How to create an overlay network? 
```
A. To create an overlay network, use the docker network create --driver overlay my-network command. You can customize it by specifying options like subnet and gateway. 
B. Creating an overlay network is impossible; Docker only supports bridge networks. 
C. Use the docker create network command to generate an overlay network. 
D. Overlay networks are created when you initialize a Docker swarm.
```

The correct answer is:

**A. To create an overlay network, use the docker network create --driver overlay my-network command. You can customize it by specifying options like subnet and gateway.**

### Explanation:
- **Overlay networks** are created using the `docker network create` command with the `--driver overlay` flag. This type of network is used to enable communication between containers running on different Docker hosts within a Docker Swarm.
- You can also customize the overlay network by specifying additional options such as subnet and gateway.

For example, to create an overlay network named `my-network`:

```bash
docker network create --driver overlay my-network
```

If you'd like to specify a subnet and gateway, you could do it like this:

```bash
docker network create --driver overlay --subnet 10.0.0.0/24 --gateway 10.0.0.1 my-network
```

### Other options:
- **B** is incorrect because Docker supports more than just bridge networks; overlay networks are specifically used in Swarm mode.
- **C** is incorrect because `docker create network` is not a valid command. The correct command is `docker network create`.
- **D** is incorrect because although overlay networks are important in Swarm mode, they are not automatically created when you initialize a swarm. You need to explicitly create them. Only one overlay network ingress gets created when initialising a swarm or joining a swarm.

Yes, when you initialize a Docker Swarm, an **overlay network** is automatically created for the services that will be deployed within the swarm. This network is called **`ingress`** and is used for routing incoming traffic to the appropriate service replicas in the swarm.

### Key Points:
- When you initialize a Docker Swarm (`docker swarm init`), the **`ingress` network** (an overlay network) is created automatically.
  - The **`ingress`** network is used for load balancing incoming traffic to services and is required for Docker Swarm to manage service discovery and routing.
  
- **Custom overlay networks** (for communication between services on different nodes) must be manually created with the `docker network create --driver overlay` command, as described earlier.

So while the `ingress` overlay network is automatically created when you initialize a swarm, other custom overlay networks that you might need for service communication need to be created separately.

### Example:
When you run:
```bash
docker swarm init
```
This automatically creates the **`ingress`** overlay network. However, if you want to create a custom overlay network, you would need to run:
```bash
docker network create --driver overlay my-overlay-network
```
