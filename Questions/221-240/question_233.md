## 233. How to revert the changes for the service configuration?
A. To revert the changes for the service configuration, you can use the docker service rollback my-service.  
B. Service configuration changes cannot be reverted once they are applied  
C. Reverting service configuration requires manual editing of the Docker Compose file.  
D. Use the docker service to undo my-service to revert the changes for the service configuration.  

The correct answer is:

**A. To revert the changes for the service configuration, you can use the `docker service rollback my-service`.**

### Explanation:
- **A** is correct because `docker service rollback` allows you to revert the service to its previous stable state after a configuration change.
- **B** is incorrect because service configuration changes can indeed be reverted using `docker service rollback`.
- **C** is incorrect because reverting changes doesn't necessarily require manual editing of the Docker Compose file.
- **D** is incorrect because `docker service to undo` is not a valid Docker command.

Thus, **A** is the correct method to roll back service configuration changes.
