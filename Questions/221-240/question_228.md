## 228. What is Docker stack?
A. A stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies and can be orchestrated and scaled together  
B. Docker stack is a command-line tool for managing Docker containers  
C. A stack is a single Docker service  
D. Docker stack is a network configuration tool for Docker containers.  

The correct answer is:

**A. A stack is a group of interrelated services that share dependencies and can be orchestrated and scaled together**

Explanation:
- A **Docker stack** refers to a collection of services that are defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file and are deployed together as a group. These services can share dependencies such as networks and volumes and can be managed as a unit. The stack makes it easier to orchestrate, scale, and deploy related services in a Docker Swarm.

The other options are incorrect:
- **B. Docker stack is a command-line tool for managing Docker containers**: This is not correct. Docker stack is a concept for organizing and deploying services, not a tool.
- **C. A stack is a single Docker service**: This is incorrect. A stack consists of multiple services, not just one.
- **D. Docker stack is a network configuration tool for Docker containers**: This is incorrect. While a stack can define network configurations for its services, it is not specifically a network configuration tool.

So, the best definition of a Docker stack is **A**.
