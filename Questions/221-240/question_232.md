## 232. How to increase the number of replicas?
A. To increase the number of replicas, you can use the docker service scale SERVICE=REPLICAS, for example, docker service scale frontend=50. You can also scale multiple services with this command  
B. You can increase the number of replicas using docker service update --replicas=50 frontend  
C. Increasing the number of replicas is only possible during the initial service deployment and cannot be modified afterward  
D. Use docker scale service=50 to adjust the number of replicas in a service  

The correct answer is:

**A. To increase the number of replicas, you can use the docker service scale SERVICE=REPLICAS, for example, docker service scale frontend=50. You can also scale multiple services with this command.**

Explanation:
- The `docker service scale` command is used to increase (or decrease) the number of replicas for a specific service in Docker Swarm. You can scale multiple services at once by specifying them in the same command, as shown in the example.

Example:
```bash
docker service scale frontend=50
```

This will scale the `frontend` service to 50 replicas.

### **Other options:**
- **B** is also valid in some cases, as `docker service update --replicas` can also be used to modify the number of replicas, but `docker service scale` is typically the more common and direct way.
- **C** is incorrect because you can change the number of replicas at any time, not just during initial deployment.
- **D** is incorrect because `docker scale` is not a valid Docker command.
