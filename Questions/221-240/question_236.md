236. Is the docker_gwbridge network created when you initialize or join a swarm?
```
A. Yes, when you start or join a swarm, the docker_gwbridge network is built.
B. No, the docker_gwbridge network must be manually configured when setting up a swarm.
C. The creation of the docker_gwbridge network depends on the specific network setup of the Docker daemon.
D. The docker_gwbridge network is only generated for swarm manager nodes.
```

The correct answer is:

**A. Yes, when you start or join a swarm, the docker_gwbridge network is built.**

### Explanation:
- The `docker_gwbridge` network is automatically created when you initialize or join a Docker Swarm. This network allows containers on overlay networks to communicate with the physical network on the host system, facilitating communication between the containers and the outside world.
  
  It is part of Docker's default networking setup in Swarm mode and enables connectivity from the overlay networks to the host's physical network.

### Other options:
- **B** is incorrect because the `docker_gwbridge` network is automatically created when the swarm is initialized or a node joins the swarm, so no manual configuration is needed.
- **C** is incorrect because the creation of the `docker_gwbridge` network is a part of the default swarm setup and doesn't depend on specific Docker daemon network configurations.
- **D** is incorrect because the `docker_gwbridge` network is created on all swarm nodes, not just manager nodes, to facilitate communication between containers on overlay networks and the external network.
