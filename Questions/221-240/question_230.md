230. How to filter the services in the stack?
A. To filter the services in the stack, use the docker stack service nginx-web --filter name=web command with the --filter flag  
B. Filtering services in the stack can be done using the docker stack filter command.  
C. Use the docker stack service nginx-web f name=web command to filter services in the stack  
D. To filter services, use the docker service filter command within the specific stack.

The correct answer is:  

**A. To filter the services in the stack, use the `docker stack service nginx-web --filter name=web` command with the `--filter` flag.**  

### Explanation:  
- The correct command syntax for filtering services within a stack involves using `docker stack services <stack_name> --filter <filter_criteria>`.  
- The `--filter` flag allows you to filter services based on specific criteria, such as name, label, or mode.  

### Why the other options are incorrect:  
- **B. `docker stack filter`** → This command does not exist in Docker.  
- **C. `docker stack service nginx-web f name=web`** → The syntax is incorrect; `f` should be `--filter`.  
- **D. `docker service filter`** → This command does not exist; service filtering is done through `docker stack services <stack_name> --filter <criteria>`.  

So, **A** is the correct answer.
