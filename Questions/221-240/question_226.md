## 226. How to find out more details about the container running these service tasks?
A. docker ps  
B. docker container inspect <container_id>  
C. docker service tasks < service>  
D. docker inspect task <task_id>  

The correct command to find out more details about the container running the service tasks is:

**B. docker container inspect <container_id>**

Explanation:
- **B**: `docker container inspect <container_id>` provides detailed information about a specific container, including its configuration, state, and resource usage.
  
The other options are incorrect:
- **A**: `docker ps` lists running containers but does not provide detailed information about a specific container.
- **C**: `docker service tasks <service>` lists tasks in a service, but it doesn't give detailed information about the containers.
- **D**: `docker inspect task <task_id>` is not a valid command. The `docker inspect` command is used for containers, images, and other resources, but the syntax is incorrect here.

So, the correct answer is **B**.
