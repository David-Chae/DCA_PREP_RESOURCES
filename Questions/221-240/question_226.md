## 226. How to find out more details about the container running these service tasks?
A. docker ps  
B. docker container inspect <container_id>  
C. docker service tasks < service>  
D. docker inspect task <task_id>  

The answer can be a bit tricky, so let's go over it thoroughly to clarify:

### Question: **How to find out more details about the container running these service tasks?**

### **Analysis of each option:**

1. **A. `docker ps`**
   - This command will **list all containers** currently running on your system.
   - It shows containers for **all services** and doesn't provide specific details about which **container is running the service tasks** for a specific Docker Swarm service.
   - **Not the most specific answer.**

2. **B. `docker container inspect <container_id>`**
   - This command provides **detailed information about a specific container**, including the network settings, volumes, and other configuration details.
   - You would use this **once you know the container ID** (which you can get using `docker ps` or `docker service tasks`).
   - **Accurate** but doesn't directly give you the service task details.

3. **C. `docker service tasks <service>`**
   - This command lists **the tasks associated with a service** in Docker Swarm.
   - It shows the **task IDs**, **container IDs**, and other info, which can help you find which containers are running the service tasks.
   - **This is a great starting point** to find containers running the service tasks and their IDs.

4. **D. `docker inspect task <task_id>`**
   - This command would give you details about a **specific Swarm task** (not directly a container).
   - Swarm tasks are the **unit of work** that a service is composed of.
   - While you can get information about the task, **this command doesn’t give you container-specific details** directly (i.e., networking or volumes).

---

### **Answer Breakdown:**

**The most accurate answer for finding details about the containers running service tasks is:**
- **C. `docker service tasks <service>`** – This will provide the list of service tasks, including the container IDs. Once you have the container ID, you can use **`docker container inspect <container_id>`** for **detailed information** about the container itself.

---

### **So why not A or D?**

- **A** (`docker ps`) is helpful but too general, as it shows all containers, not just those associated with a specific service.
- **D** (`docker inspect task <task_id>`) is useful for inspecting tasks but **doesn’t focus on container-level information** directly.

---

### **Summary:**
- To find which containers are running service tasks, **first use `docker service tasks <service>`**.
- Once you get the **container IDs**, **then use `docker container inspect <container_id>`** for more detailed information.
