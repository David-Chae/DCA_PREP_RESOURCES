## 252. In a multi-container Docker application, what is the purpose of a Docker Compose file?
A. To specify the Docker network configurations  
B. To define container resource limits  
C. To describe the services, networks, and volumes in the application  
D. To manage Docker image versions  

The correct answer is:  

**C. To describe the services, networks, and volumes in the application**  

### Explanation:  
A **Docker Compose file** (`docker-compose.yml`) is used to define and manage **multi-container Docker applications**. It allows you to describe:  
- **Services** (containers and how they interact)  
- **Networks** (how the containers communicate)  
- **Volumes** (persistent storage shared between containers)  

It simplifies deploying multiple containers by specifying everything in a single YAML file, which can then be started using `docker-compose up`.  

#### Why the other options are incorrect:  
- **A (Specify Docker network configurations)** → While the Compose file **can** define networks, its primary role is broader—it manages services, networks, and volumes together.  
- **B (Define container resource limits)** → While Compose allows setting resource limits, this is just one feature and not its primary purpose.  
- **D (Manage Docker image versions)** → The Compose file can specify which image to use, but managing versions is typically done through image tags and Dockerfiles.  

Thus, **C is the best answer** as the Docker Compose file is primarily used to define the services, networks, and volumes in a multi-container application.
