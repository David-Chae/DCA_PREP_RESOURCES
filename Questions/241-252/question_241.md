## 241. How to find which networks the service is connected to?

A. To find out which networks the service is connected to, you can use docker network inspect my-network. Alternatively, you can use docker service ls to find the service name and then docker service ps <SERVICE> to list the networks it is connected to.  
B. You can determine the service's connected networks by using the docker network list <SERVICE>  
C. Finding the networks a service is connected to is not possible through Docker commands  
D. Use docker service network <SERVICE> to list the networks to which a service is connected.

### ‚ùå Why **Option A** is misleading:

You're spot on:

- `docker network inspect my-network`  
  ‚Üí **Shows containers**, but not directly which **services** those containers are part of.
  
- `docker service ps <service>`  
  ‚Üí Lists **tasks/containers** of the service, but **not their network details**.

- So while you could *infer* some connections through container inspection, it‚Äôs **indirect and incomplete**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Correct approach (not in any listed option):**

The **most accurate** way to see which networks a service is connected to is:

```bash
docker service inspect <service-name> --format '{{json .Spec.Networks}}'
```

Or the more readable:

```bash
docker service inspect <service-name> --pretty
```

This will clearly show:

- Networks the service is connected to.
- Network names or IDs under the `Spec.Networks` section.

### Let's revisit the options:

#### A. ‚ùå *Incorrect / Misleading*
As discussed ‚Äî it‚Äôs indirect, and doesn‚Äôt give you service-to-network mapping cleanly.

#### B. ‚ùå Incorrect  
`docker network list` only lists available networks, no relation to services.

#### C. ‚ùå Incorrect  
You **can** definitely find service-network connections via proper inspect commands.

#### D. ‚ùå Invalid command  
`docker service network` doesn‚Äôt exist.

### üü© So what's the right answer?

Technically, **none of the listed options are fully correct**.

> ‚úÖ The most accurate answer should have been:  
> **"Use `docker service inspect <service-name>` to view which networks a service is connected to."**

If you‚Äôd like, I can help rewrite the question and answers to be technically precise.
