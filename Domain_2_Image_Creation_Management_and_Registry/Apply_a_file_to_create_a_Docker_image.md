# Creating a Docker Image from a Dockerfile

## Overview

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains instructions for building a Docker image. By defining a series of commands and configurations, you can create a Docker image that includes your application and its dependencies.

## Steps to Create a Docker Image

### Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

First, create a `Dockerfile` in your project directory. Here is an example of a simple `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:14

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files
COPY package*.json ./

# Install the dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["node", "app.js"]
```

### Step 2: Build the Docker Image

Use the `docker build` command to create a Docker image from the `Dockerfile`. Run the following command in the directory where your `Dockerfile` is located:

```bash
docker build -t myapp:latest .
```

In this example:
- `-t myapp:latest` tags the image with the name `myapp` and the tag `latest`.
- The `.` at the end specifies the build context, which is the current directory.

### Step 3: Verify the Docker Image

After the build process completes, verify that the image has been created successfully by listing all Docker images:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see the newly created image `myapp:latest` in the list.

### Example Output

```
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
myapp               latest              abc123              1 minute ago        450MB
node                14                  def456              2 days ago          914MB
```

### Step 4: Run the Docker Image

To run a container using the newly created image, use the `docker run` command:

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest
```

In this example, the container will map port 8080 on the host to port 8080 in the container, allowing you to access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:8080`.
