# Storing a Docker Image in a Registry

## Overview

A Docker registry is a storage and distribution system for Docker images. Docker Hub is the most widely used registry, but you can also use private registries or other public registries. Storing images in a registry allows you to share and deploy them across different environments.

## Steps to Store an Image in a Docker Registry

### Step 1: Tag the Image

Before pushing an image to a registry, you need to tag it with the appropriate repository name. The tag format is `repository/image_name:tag`.

```bash
docker tag myimage:latest myregistry/myimage:latest
```

In this example:
- `myimage:latest` is the existing image name and tag.
- `myregistry/myimage:latest` is the new tag for the image, where `myregistry` is the registry name.

### Step 2: Log In to the Registry

Log in to the Docker registry using the `docker login` command. You'll need to provide your username and password.

```bash
docker login myregistry
```

For Docker Hub, the command is:

```bash
docker login
```

### Step 3: Push the Image

Push the tagged image to the registry using the `docker push` command.

```bash
docker push myregistry/myimage:latest
```

This command uploads the image to the specified registry.

### Step 4: Verify the Image in the Registry

After pushing the image, you can verify that it is stored in the registry by listing the images in your registry account.
