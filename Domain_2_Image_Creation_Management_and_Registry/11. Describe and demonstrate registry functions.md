## 🔧 Key Functions of a Docker Registry

1. **Image Storage**:Provides a central repository for Docker images
2. **Version Control**:Utilizes tags (e.g., `myapp:1.0`) to manage image versions
3. **Access Control**:Implements authentication and authorization to manage image access
4. **Image Distribution**:Facilitates the sharing of images across various environments like development, staging, and production
5. **Scalability**:Designed to scale horizontally, accommodating large-scale deployments

  - **GitHub Container Registry** Integrates with GitHub repositorie.

## 🚀 Demonstration: Setting Up and Using a Local Docker Registry

### 1. **Run a Local Registry Container*

You can deploy a local registry using Docker's official imae:

```bah
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name local-registry registr:2
```


This command starts a registry accessible at `localhost:500`.

### 2. **Tag and Push an Image to the Local Registry*

Assuming you have an image named `myap`:

```bah
docker tag myapp localhost:5000/mypp
docker push localhost:5000/myapp
```


This tags your image for the local registry and then pushes t.

### 3. **Pull the Image from the Local Registry*

To retrieve the imae:

```bah
docker pull localhost:5000/mypp
```


This pulls the image from your local registy.
