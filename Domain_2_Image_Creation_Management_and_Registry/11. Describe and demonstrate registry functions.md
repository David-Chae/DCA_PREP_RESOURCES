Docker **registries** are a core concept to understand for both practical container workflows and certification exams like the **Docker Certified Associate**.

Let’s break down the **registry functions**, and then **demonstrate** them with clear CLI commands.

## 🧠 What is a Docker Registry?

A **Docker registry** is a storage and distribution system for Docker images.

- The **default registry** is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
- You can also use **private registries** (e.g., Harbor, AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry, etc.).

## ✅ Key Registry Functions

| Function        | Description                                           | Example CLI                                |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Login**       | Authenticate with a registry                         | `docker login`                             |
| **Tag**         | Tag an image for pushing to a registry               | `docker tag`                               |
| **Push**        | Upload a local image to a registry                   | `docker push`                              |
| **Pull**        | Download an image from a registry                    | `docker pull`                              |
| **Search**      | Search images in Docker Hub                         | `docker search`                            |
| **Logout**      | End your authenticated session                       | `docker logout`                            |

## 🛠️ Demonstration of Registry Functions

Let's go step by step using Docker Hub as our registry.

---

### 🔐 1. Log in to Docker Hub

```bash
docker login
```

You'll be prompted to enter your **Docker Hub username and password**.

---

### 🏷️ 2. Tag a Local Image

Let’s say you have an image called `myapp:latest`.

```bash
docker tag myapp:latest yourdockerhubusername/myapp:latest
```

> This tells Docker where to push the image — `yourdockerhubusername` should match your Docker Hub ID.

---

### 🚀 3. Push the Image to Docker Hub

```bash
docker push yourdockerhubusername/myapp:latest
```

> This uploads the image to Docker Hub.

---

### 📥 4. Pull the Image from Registry

```bash
docker pull yourdockerhubusername/myapp:latest
```

---

### 🔎 5. Search for Images on Docker Hub

```bash
docker search nginx
```

You’ll see a list of images with description, official tag, stars, etc.

---

### 👋 6. Logout from Docker Hub

```bash
docker logout
```

This ends your authenticated session.

---

## 📦 BONUS: Use a Local or Private Registry

You can also **run your own local registry** like this:

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry:2
```

Then tag and push to it:

```bash
docker tag myapp localhost:5000/myapp
docker push localhost:5000/myapp
```

You can pull from it as well:

```bash
docker pull localhost:5000/myapp
```

## ✅ Summary

| Command               | Purpose                          |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `docker login`        | Auth to registry                 |
| `docker tag`          | Prepare image for push           |
| `docker push`         | Upload image to registry         |
| `docker pull`         | Download image from registry     |
| `docker search`       | Discover public images           |
| `docker logout`       | Disconnect session               |
