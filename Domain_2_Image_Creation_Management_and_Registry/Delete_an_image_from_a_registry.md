# Deleting a Docker Image from a Registry

## Overview

Deleting a Docker image from a registry involves using the registry's API or user interface. The process may vary depending on the type of registry you are using (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, Amazon ECR, etc.). This guide provides general instructions for deleting images from a Docker registry.

## Steps to Delete a Docker Image from a Registry

### Step 1: Log into the Registry

Before deleting an image, ensure you are logged into the registry. Use the `docker login` command followed by the registry's address:

```bash
docker login <registry_address>
```

For example, to log into Docker Hub:

```bash
docker login
```

### Step 2: List the Images in the Registry

List the images in your registry to find the image you want to delete. Use the registry's user interface or API to view the available images.

### Step 3: Delete the Image

#### Using Docker Hub

To delete an image from Docker Hub, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Docker Hub through a web browser.
2. Navigate to the repository containing the image.
3. Select the image tag you want to delete.
4. Click the "Delete" button and confirm the deletion.

#### Using Azure Container Registry

To delete an image from Azure Container Registry, use the Azure CLI:

```bash
az acr repository delete --name <registry_name> --image <repository_name>:<tag> --yes
```

For example:

```bash
az acr repository delete --name myRegistry --image myRepository:latest --yes
```

#### Using Amazon ECR

To delete an image from Amazon ECR, use the AWS CLI:

```bash
aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name <repository_name> --image-ids imageTag=<tag>
```

For example:

```bash
aws ecr batch-delete-image --repository-name myRepository --image-ids imageTag=latest
```
