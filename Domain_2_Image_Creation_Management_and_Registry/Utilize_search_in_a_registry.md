# Utilizing Search in a Docker Registry

## Overview

Searching within a Docker registry allows you to find specific images based on various criteria such as name, description, and tags. This guide provides instructions on how to use the search functionality in Docker registries.

## Steps to Utilize Search in a Docker Registry

### Step 1: Open Your Terminal

Open a terminal on your machine where Docker is installed.

### Step 2: Use the `docker search` Command

Run the `docker search` command followed by the search term:

```bash
docker search <search_term>
```

For example, to search for images containing the term "nginx", you would run:

```bash
docker search nginx
```

### Step 3: Use Search Options

You can use various options with the `docker search` command to refine your search results:

- **Filter by Stars**: Show images with a specific number of stars.

```bash
docker search --filter stars=3 nginx
```

- **Filter by Official Images**: Show only official images.

```bash
docker search --filter is-official=true nginx
```

- **Limit Results**: Limit the number of search results.

```bash
docker search --limit 5 nginx
```

### Step 4: View Search Results

The search results will display a list of images that match your search criteria, along with their descriptions and star ratings.

### Example Output

```bash
NAME                             DESCRIPTION                                     STARS     OFFICIAL

odise/busybox-python            This image is meant to be used as the base...  2         [ ]
```
