# Understanding Docker Image Deletion

## Overview

Deleting Docker images is a crucial aspect of managing Docker environments. It helps free up disk space and removes outdated or unnecessary images. This guide explains how image deletion works and the commands used to delete Docker images.

## How Docker Image Deletion Works

### Removing Local Images

To delete local Docker images from your system, use the `docker rmi` command followed by the image ID or tag.

```bash
docker rmi <image_id_or_tag>
```

For example, to delete an image with the ID `abc123`, you would run:

```bash
docker rmi abc123
```

### Force Deleting Images

If an image is being used by a running container, you may need to force delete it by using the `-f` flag.

```bash
docker rmi -f <image_id_or_tag>
```

### Removing Dangling Images

Dangling images are layers that have no relationship to any tagged images. You can remove these images using the `docker image prune` command.

```bash
docker image prune
```

This will prompt you to confirm the deletion. To bypass the prompt, use the `-f` (force) flag:

```bash
docker image prune -f
```

### Removing All Unused Images

To remove all unused Docker images, use the `-a` flag with the `docker image prune` command. This will delete all images that are not currently in use by any containers.

```bash
docker image prune -a
```

### Removing Images from a Registry

To delete images from a Docker registry, you must use the registry's API or user interface, as the `docker rmi` command only deletes local images. Refer to your registry's documentation for specific instructions on deleting images.
