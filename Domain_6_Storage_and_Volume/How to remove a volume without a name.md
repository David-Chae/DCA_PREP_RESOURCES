If you're seeing a **vieux/sshfs volume without a name** on your **Docker manager node** and you want to remove it, here's how to handle it.

---

### ðŸ§© Step-by-Step

#### âœ… 1. **List all volumes**
```bash
docker volume ls
```

You might see something like:
```
DRIVER          VOLUME NAME
vieux/sshfs
local           mydata
```

If there's no `VOLUME NAME`, the `vieux/sshfs` entry is likely corrupted or misconfigured.

---

#### âœ… 2. **Find dangling or unnamed volumes**

Try:
```bash
docker volume ls -qf dangling=true
```

Or:
```bash
docker volume inspect $(docker volume ls -q)
```

Look for volumes where `"Name"` is empty or not well-formed.

---

#### âœ… 3. **Remove the bad volume**

If it actually has an ID but no name, you can still try removing it by ID:

```bash
docker volume rm <volume-id-or-name>
```

If `docker volume ls` shows an empty name, try this:

```bash
docker volume ls -q --filter driver=vieux/sshfs | xargs -r docker volume rm
```

This removes **all volumes** with the `vieux/sshfs` driver. Be **careful** if you're using other sshfs volumes.

---

#### ðŸ›‘ If Itâ€™s Really Stuckâ€¦

If the volume is somehow corrupt and Docker refuses to remove it:

- Restart the Docker daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

- Then reattempt the removal.

---

#### ðŸ’¡ Bonus: Inspect volume metadata manually

Docker stores volume metadata in:

```bash
/var/lib/docker/volumes/
```

If thereâ€™s a rogue directory without a proper config, you can **manually** delete it **(only if you're sure itâ€™s unused)**:

```bash
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/docker/volumes/<volume-id-or-directory>
```

Then restart Docker.

Let me know if you're in Swarm mode and this volume is part of a service â€” that could affect how it's managed.
