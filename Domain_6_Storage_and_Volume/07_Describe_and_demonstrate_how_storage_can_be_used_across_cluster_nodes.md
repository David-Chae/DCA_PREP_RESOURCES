# Using Storage Across Cluster Nodes in Docker

## Overview

In a distributed Docker environment, multiple nodes are often grouped together in a cluster (e.g., Docker Swarm or Kubernetes) to ensure high availability, load balancing, and fault tolerance. For applications to maintain data consistency and accessibility across these nodes, it is essential to have shared storage that can be accessed from any node in the cluster.

This guide explains how storage can be utilized across cluster nodes using Docker, with demonstrations and links to relevant official documentation.

## Storage Options for Docker Clusters

Docker itself doesn't provide a built-in distributed storage solution; however, you can use external storage options to manage data across nodes in a cluster. Here are the most commonly used solutions:

1. **Docker Volumes with Networked Storage**
2. **Distributed File Systems (e.g., GlusterFS, Ceph)**
3. **Cloud Storage Services (e.g., AWS EFS, Azure Files)**
4. **NFS (Network File System)**

Each of these storage solutions can be integrated with Docker to provide persistent storage that works across multiple nodes in a cluster.

### 1. Docker Volumes with Networked Storage

Docker volumes can be created on a networked file system (e.g., NFS, GlusterFS) that is shared across multiple nodes. This allows containers on different nodes to access the same volume.

#### Step 1: Create a Networked Storage Volume
In a cluster, first set up your networked storage solution, such as NFS, GlusterFS, or Ceph. These solutions provide a way for storage to be shared among nodes.

For example, if you use **NFS**, you need to mount the NFS share on each node in the cluster.

```bash
# Example for mounting an NFS share on each node
mount -t nfs <nfs-server>:/path/to/share /mnt/storage
```

#### Step 2: Create a Docker Volume Using the NFS Mount

Once the networked storage is mounted, you can create a Docker volume that points to the networked storage.

```bash
docker volume create --driver local \
  --opt type=nfs \
  --opt o=addr=<nfs-server>,rw \
  --opt device=:/path/to/share \
  my_shared_volume
```

Now, any container created on any node in the cluster can use the `my_shared_volume` volume.

#### Step 3: Mount the Volume in Containers

To use this shared volume in a container, simply mount it as you would with any other Docker volume.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v my_shared_volume:/data \
  --name my_app_container \
  my_image
```

The `/data` directory in `my_app_container` will be backed by the shared storage, and it will be accessible from any node in the cluster.

### 2. Using Distributed File Systems (GlusterFS, Ceph)

Distributed file systems like **GlusterFS** and **Ceph** provide an ideal solution for managing storage across a cluster, offering scalable and redundant file storage.

#### Step 1: Set Up GlusterFS or Ceph

You first need to set up and configure your distributed file system on all nodes in the cluster. For example, for GlusterFS, you would:

```bash
# Install GlusterFS on all nodes
apt-get install glusterfs-server

# Create a volume on the first node
gluster volume create my_volume transport tcp node1:/brick1 node2:/brick2
gluster volume start my_volume
```

#### Step 2: Create a Docker Volume Linked to the Distributed Storage

After setting up GlusterFS or Ceph, you can create a Docker volume that links to the distributed file system.

```bash
docker volume create \
  --driver glusterfs \
  --opt volume=my_volume \
  --opt endpoint=<gluster-node-ip> \
  my_glusterfs_volume
```

#### Step 3: Use the Volume in Docker Containers

Finally, you can mount this volume in your Docker containers as a persistent shared storage across nodes.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v my_glusterfs_volume:/data \
  --name my_gluster_app \
  my_image
```

### 3. Cloud Storage Services (AWS EFS, Azure Files)

Cloud storage services such as **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** and **Azure Files** offer managed networked file systems that can be easily integrated with Docker to provide shared storage across nodes in a cluster.

#### Step 1: Set Up Cloud Storage

For AWS EFS, you would first create an EFS file system from the AWS Management Console and ensure it is mounted on all nodes in your cluster.

#### Step 2: Create a Docker Volume Linked to the Cloud Storage

Once your cloud storage is set up, you can create a Docker volume that links to it. For AWS EFS, you can mount it using the NFS driver.

```bash
docker volume create --driver local \
  --opt type=nfs \
  --opt o=addr=<efs-dns-name>,rw \
  --opt device=:/ \
  my_efs_volume
```

#### Step 3: Mount the Volume in Containers

You can now use the cloud-based volume in your Docker containers as persistent storage.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v my_efs_volume:/data \
  --name my_cloud_app \
  my_image
```

### 4. Network File System (NFS)

NFS allows nodes in a cluster to share the same storage by accessing files through a network.

#### Step 1: Set Up NFS Server and Mount on All Nodes

Set up an NFS server on one of the nodes or an external machine, and export the directory to be shared.

```bash
# On NFS server
exportfs -a
```

Then, mount the NFS share on all other nodes.

```bash
mount -t nfs <nfs-server>:/shared/storage /mnt/storage
```

#### Step 2: Create Docker Volume Linked to NFS

Create a Docker volume linked to the NFS mount on the nodes.

```bash
docker volume create --driver local \
  --opt type=nfs \
  --opt o=addr=<nfs-server>,rw \
  --opt device=:/shared/storage \
  my_nfs_volume
```

#### Step 3: Use the Volume in Containers

Now, you can use this shared NFS volume in your containers.

```bash
docker run -d \
  -v my_nfs_volume:/data \
  --name my_nfs_container \
  my_image
```
