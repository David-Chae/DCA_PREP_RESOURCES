# Understanding the Types of Traffic Between Docker Engine, Registry, and UCP Controllers

## Introduction

Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) provides a highly scalable and secure platform for managing containerized applications. When using Docker in a multi-node environment, such as Docker Swarm or with Universal Control Plane (UCP), several types of traffic flow between various components, including the Docker Engine, registry, and UCP controllers.

This document outlines the different types of traffic between the Docker engine, registry, and UCP controllers, helping to understand the data flow and the associated ports and protocols used.

## Key Components

1. **Docker Engine**: The runtime that manages containers, images, networks, and volumes.
2. **Docker Registry**: A repository for storing and retrieving container images.
3. **UCP Controllers**: The management layer of Docker EE that handles container orchestration, security, and scaling.

## Types of Traffic

The types of traffic flow between these components vary depending on the role and the type of interaction being made. Below are the primary types of traffic that occur between the Docker engine, registry, and UCP controllers.

### 1. **Traffic Between Docker Engine and UCP Controllers**

The Docker engine communicates with UCP controllers for tasks like orchestrating services, managing nodes, and applying configurations. The traffic involved here includes:

- **Authentication Traffic**: When the Docker engine communicates with UCP, authentication tokens are exchanged. This ensures that only authorized Docker engines can join the Swarm cluster or access certain resources.
- **Control Traffic**: This is the communication between the Docker engine and UCP to retrieve orchestration tasks, service configurations, secrets, and environment variables. This traffic is crucial for keeping the engine synchronized with UCP.
- **Metrics and Health Check Traffic**: Docker engines periodically send status, health, and resource metrics (such as CPU, memory, and disk usage) to UCP to allow for monitoring and scaling of services.

#### Ports and Protocols:
- UCP API: `443` (HTTPS) – UCP controllers communicate with Docker engines using the HTTPS protocol for secure API calls.
- Docker Engine: `2377` (TCP) – This port is used for management traffic between the Docker engine and the Swarm manager (including UCP controllers).

### 2. **Traffic Between Docker Engine and Docker Registry**

When a Docker engine pulls or pushes container images, it communicates with the Docker registry. The traffic involved includes:

- **Image Pull Traffic**: When a Docker engine needs to pull an image from the registry (either public like Docker Hub or private), it sends a request to download the image layers. This traffic is typically HTTPS traffic, ensuring that image transfers are encrypted and secure.
- **Image Push Traffic**: If a Docker engine has built or updated an image and wants to push it to the registry, the engine sends the image layers to the registry over HTTPS.
- **Metadata Traffic**: Docker engines may also send metadata about images (e.g., image tags, size, and layers) to the registry for storage and indexing.

#### Ports and Protocols:
- Docker Registry (HTTPS): `443` – HTTPS traffic is used to push and pull images from the registry securely.
- Docker Registry (HTTP): `80` – In some configurations, the registry may also be accessible over HTTP for non-secure transfers, but HTTPS is recommended for security.

### 3. **Traffic Between UCP Controllers and Docker Registry**

UCP controllers also interact with the Docker registry to manage and deploy containerized applications. This traffic includes:

- **Image Fetching Traffic**: UCP controllers retrieve container images from the registry to deploy and run services within the Swarm cluster.
- **Authentication Traffic**: When pulling images from a private registry, UCP controllers will authenticate using the credentials provided (such as username/password or an API token).

#### Ports and Protocols:
- Docker Registry (HTTPS): `443` – UCP controllers pull images from the registry over HTTPS, ensuring secure image transmission.
- Docker Registry (HTTP): `80` – Similar to the Docker engine, UCP controllers can also interact with the registry over HTTP (though this is generally not recommended for production environments).

## Secure Communication

All of the traffic mentioned above should be encrypted, especially when dealing with sensitive data like authentication tokens and container images. Docker EE ensures that communications between the Docker engine, UCP controllers, and registry are secure by utilizing:

- **TLS/SSL** for encrypted traffic between Docker components.
- **Authentication tokens** to authenticate Docker engines and UCP controllers to the registry.
- **Docker secrets** for securely handling credentials between Docker engine and UCP.

## Example Data Flow

Here is an example of how traffic flows when deploying an application:

1. **Deploying an Application Using UCP**:
   - A user accesses the UCP web interface or API to deploy an application.
   - The UCP controller sends control traffic to the Docker engine to manage the containers.
   - If the application requires images, the UCP controller retrieves them from the registry, sending secure pull requests over HTTPS.
   - The Docker engine starts the containers and begins managing the application lifecycle.

2. **Pulling and Pushing Images**:
   - When an image is pulled by a Docker engine from the registry, it sends HTTPS requests to the registry, requesting image layers.
   - If the Docker engine builds a new image, it sends a push request to the registry to upload the image layers securely.

## Official Documentation

## Conclusion
Understanding the types of traffic between the Docker engine, registry, and UCP controllers is essential for ensuring a secure and efficient Docker EE deployment. By properly configuring the communication channels and securing traffic with TLS/SSL, you can ensure the safety and reliability of your containerized applications in a production environment.
