# Creating a Docker Bridge Network for Developers

## Introduction

In Docker, a **bridge network** is a private internal network created on the host system where containers can communicate with each other. Developers can use this type of network to isolate container traffic from the host network, while still allowing containers to talk to each other.

In this guide, we'll walk through the steps of creating a Docker bridge network and demonstrate how developers can use it to connect their containers.

## What is a Docker Bridge Network?

The **bridge network driver** is the default network driver for Docker containers when they are run without a specified network. It creates a private network on the host system and assigns containers connected to this network a virtual IP address.

Containers on the same bridge network can communicate with each other using container names or IP addresses. However, containers connected to the bridge network cannot directly communicate with containers on other networks or the outside world, unless specific port mappings are created.

## Steps to Create a Docker Bridge Network

### 1. **Create the Bridge Network**

To create a custom bridge network, use the following Docker CLI command:

```bash
docker network create --driver bridge my_custom_bridge_network
```

This command creates a custom bridge network named `my_custom_bridge_network` on your host.

#### Explanation:
- `--driver bridge`: Specifies the bridge network driver.
- `my_custom_bridge_network`: The name of the network you're creating. You can use any name you prefer.

### 2. **Verify the Network Creation**

After creating the network, you can verify that it exists by running:

```bash
docker network ls
```

This command will list all Docker networks. You should see `my_custom_bridge_network` in the list of networks.

### 3. **Run Containers on the Bridge Network**

Now that the bridge network is created, you can run containers and attach them to this network. You can do this by specifying the `--network` flag when running a container:

```bash
docker run -d --name container1 --network my_custom_bridge_network nginx
```

This command runs a container named `container1` using the `nginx` image and connects it to the `my_custom_bridge_network`.

Repeat this step to create more containers that will communicate over the same bridge network:

```bash
docker run -d --name container2 --network my_custom_bridge_network redis
```

### 4. **Test Communication Between Containers**

Once the containers are running, you can test if they can communicate with each other by using their container names.

To test this, enter the shell of `container1`:

```bash
docker exec -it container1 /bin/bash
```

From within `container1`, try to ping `container2` using its container name:

```bash
ping container2
```

You should see a successful ping response, indicating that the containers are able to communicate with each other on the same bridge network.

### 5. **View Network Details**

To view the details of the bridge network, including its IP address range, you can run:

```bash
docker network inspect my_custom_bridge_network
```

This command will provide detailed information about the bridge network, such as the subnet, gateway, and connected containers.

## Example Docker Compose Setup (Optional)

For developers who want to define and manage multi-container applications, Docker Compose can be used to set up containers on the same bridge network.

Here's an example `docker-compose.yml` file that creates two containers connected to a custom bridge network:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    networks:
      - my_custom_bridge_network
  db:
    image: redis
    networks:
      - my_custom_bridge_network

networks:
  my_custom_bridge_network:
    driver: bridge
```

To use this `docker-compose.yml` file:
1. Create a directory and save the file as `docker-compose.yml`.
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` to start the containers and create the bridge network.

### Explanation:
- The `web` service runs an `nginx` container, and the `db` service runs a `redis` container.
- Both containers are connected to the same `my_custom_bridge_network`.

## Cleaning Up

After testing, you can remove the created containers and network:

```bash
docker rm -f container1 container2
docker network rm my_custom_bridge_network
```

## Official Documentation

For more details on Docker networks and the bridge driver, refer to the official Docker documentation:

- [Docker Compose Networking](https://docs.docker.com/compose/networking/)

## Conclusion

Creating a Docker bridge network allows developers to set up isolated communication channels between containers on the same host. This can be useful for development, testing, and running multiple containers that need to interact with each other. By using Docker CLI or Docker Compose, developers can easily manage their containers' networking and ensure smooth container-to-container communication.
