# Comparison of "Host" and "Ingress" Publishing Modes in Docker

## Introduction

When running containers in Docker, you often need to expose their ports to allow communication from outside the container. Docker provides two primary publishing modes for this: **host** and **ingress**. Both modes determine how ports are mapped and accessed externally, but they differ in their functionality and use cases.

This document compares and contrasts the `host` and `ingress` publishing modes, detailing their advantages, limitations, and when to use each mode.

## What are Publishing Modes?

Docker allows you to publish a container’s internal port to a port on the Docker host machine. This can be done using different publishing modes:

- **Host mode**: Directly exposes the container's port on the host's network.
- **Ingress mode**: Uses a routing mechanism for publishing ports, especially in Docker Swarm mode.

## Host Mode Publishing

### Overview

In **host mode**, the container port is mapped directly to the host port. This means that the container’s network stack is directly bound to the host’s network interface, allowing the container to access the host’s networking without the usual network isolation.

### Features

- The container port is **directly bound** to a specific port on the host machine.
- No network isolation between the container and the host.
- Traffic is **routed directly** to the container from the host, making it faster for services that require direct access to host networking.
- Host mode is available in **non-Swarm mode** only, as it doesn't support routing traffic in a distributed fashion.

### Use Cases

- When you need the container to **access the host’s network directly** (e.g., for high-performance applications or when using specific networking features like multicast).
- For **legacy applications** that require direct access to the host’s networking.
- When you want to **avoid NAT (Network Address Translation)**, as the container shares the network namespace with the host.

### Example

To run a container in host mode, use the `--publish` flag with the `host` option:

```bash
docker run -d --publish host:8080:80 my_image
```

Here, the container’s port `80` is directly exposed as port `8080` on the host machine.

### Advantages

- **Performance**: Less overhead compared to other modes because there's no additional networking layer.
- **Simplicity**: Direct mapping to the host’s network, with fewer steps involved.

### Disadvantages

- **Lack of isolation**: The container shares the host's network, which can be a security concern in some scenarios.
- **Limited scalability**: Host mode does not work in Docker Swarm mode or in clusters.

## Ingress Mode Publishing

### Overview

In **ingress mode**, traffic is routed through a **load balancer** to the appropriate container, typically used in Docker Swarm mode. This mode allows you to deploy services across multiple nodes in a Swarm cluster and have traffic automatically routed to the appropriate container on the correct node.

### Features

- Ingress mode is **used only in Docker Swarm mode**.
- Traffic is routed through a **Swarm-managed routing mesh** and distributed to containers based on their availability and load.
- The ports are published on **all nodes in the Swarm cluster**, with a virtual IP address managing the traffic distribution.
- Requires Docker’s **routing mesh** to balance traffic and distribute it to containers across the nodes in the cluster.

### Use Cases

- When deploying services in a **Docker Swarm cluster**, and you need to expose services to external clients.
- For **distributed applications** where traffic needs to be balanced across multiple containers running on different nodes.
- When using **load balancing** to automatically route traffic to available containers, providing fault tolerance.

### Example

To use ingress mode, simply publish the port without specifying a host:

```bash
docker service create --name my_service --publish 8080:80 my_image
```

This makes the service accessible on port `8080` through the Swarm's ingress network. The load balancer automatically routes traffic to the available containers.

### Advantages

- **Scalability**: Works well in Docker Swarm mode, enabling service discovery and traffic load balancing.
- **Fault tolerance**: Traffic is routed to available containers, ensuring high availability.
- **Automatic Load Balancing**: Ingress mode enables automatic distribution of traffic across multiple nodes.

### Disadvantages

- **Overhead**: The routing mesh introduces additional complexity and networking overhead compared to host mode.
- **Requires Docker Swarm**: This mode only works in Swarm mode, limiting its use to cluster environments.

## Key Differences

| Feature                      | Host Mode                        | Ingress Mode                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Mode Availability**         | Non-Swarm mode only              | Swarm mode only                    |
| **Network Binding**           | Directly binds to the host’s network | Uses routing mesh and load balancing |
| **Scalability**               | Limited to one host              | Works across multiple nodes in a Swarm |
| **Performance**               | Higher performance, less overhead | Some performance overhead due to routing |
| **Security**                  | Less network isolation           | Better network isolation due to routing |
| **Use Case**                  | Legacy apps, direct access to host | Distributed apps, load-balanced services |

## Official Documentation

For more information on publishing modes, refer to the official Docker documentation:

- [Publish a port for a service](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/ingress/#publish-a-port-for-tcp-only-or-udp-only)

## Conclusion

- **Host mode** is best for scenarios where you need direct access to the host network with low overhead and high performance, but it lacks scalability and isolation.
- **Ingress mode** is designed for Docker Swarm and is ideal for distributed applications, providing automatic load balancing and fault tolerance across multiple nodes.

Each mode has its use cases and trade-offs, so the choice between them depends on your specific requirements, whether you're working with a single host or a Swarm cluster.
