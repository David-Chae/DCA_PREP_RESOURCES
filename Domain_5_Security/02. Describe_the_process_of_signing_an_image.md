# Signing a Docker Image in a Registry

## Overview

Signing Docker images increases trust by verifying the integrity and authenticity of the images. Docker Content Trust (DCT) provides the ability to use digital signatures for data sent to and received from remote Docker registries.

## Steps to Sign a Docker Image

### Step 1: Enable Docker Content Trust

Enable Docker Content Trust to start signing images:

```bash
export DOCKER_CONTENT_TRUST=1
```

### Step 2: Generate a Signing Key Pair

Generate a key pair for signing images:

```bash
docker trust key generate your-name
```

You will be prompted to enter a passphrase. This passphrase will be required each time you sign or verify images.

### Step 3: Sign the Docker Image

Tag the image and sign it using the `docker trust sign` command:

```bash
docker trust sign <image_name>:<tag>
```

For example:

```bash
docker trust sign myimage:latest
```

### Step 4: Push the Signed Image to the Registry

Push the signed image to the registry:

```bash
docker push <registry_address>/<image_name>:<tag>
```

For example:

```bash
docker push myregistry/myimage:latest
```

### Step 5: Verify the Signed Image

To verify the signed image, use the `docker trust inspect` command:

```bash
docker trust inspect <image_name>:<tag>
```

For example:

```bash
docker trust inspect myimage:latest
```
