# Mutual TLS (mTLS) in Docker

## Introduction
Mutual TLS (mTLS) is a security mechanism that ensures **both the client and the server authenticate each other** using TLS certificates. Docker Swarm mode relies on mTLS for secure communication between nodes.

## 1. How mTLS Works
mTLS enhances standard TLS by requiring both parties to verify each other's identity before establishing a connection:
- The **client** presents its certificate to the server.
- The **server** verifies the client’s certificate.
- The **server** presents its certificate to the client.
- The **client** verifies the server’s certificate.
- Only after successful verification, communication is established.

## 2. mTLS in Docker Swarm
Docker Swarm mode uses mTLS to **secure inter-node communication** by:
- **Authenticating and encrypting** all node communications.
- Using a **built-in Certificate Authority (CA)** to issue node certificates.
- **Automatically rotating certificates** to maintain security.
- **Verifying identity** for both managers and worker nodes.

## 3. Key Features of mTLS in Docker
- **Automated Certificate Management**: Swarm automatically generates and rotates certificates.
- **Node Role-Based Security**: Only authorized nodes can communicate.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Ensures confidentiality and integrity of data between nodes.
- **Resilience Against Spoofing**: Prevents unauthorized entities from joining the swarm.

## 4. Benefits of mTLS in Docker
- **Stronger Authentication**: Both parties must validate each other.
- **Encryption by Default**: Ensures secure data transmission.
- **Simplified Security Management**: No need for manual certificate handling.
- **Protection Against MITM Attacks**: Ensures only trusted nodes can communicate.

## 5. Configuring mTLS in Docker Swarm
mTLS is enabled by default in Docker Swarm mode. To inspect a node’s TLS certificate:
```sh
docker node inspect <node_name> --pretty
```
To manually rotate certificates:
```sh
docker swarm ca --rotate
```

## Conclusion
mTLS is a crucial security feature in Docker Swarm that ensures **secure, authenticated, and encrypted** communication between nodes. Understanding its implementation is essential for maintaining a secure Swarm environment.
